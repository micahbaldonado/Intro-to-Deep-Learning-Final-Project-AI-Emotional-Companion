# Intro to Deep Learning Final Project: AI Emotional Companion

This project presents the development of an AI Emotional Companion that detects and responds empathetically to user emotions. The goal was to design an intelligent system capable of recognizing emotional states from speech and offering appropriate, supportive interactions through a streamlined application interface.

## Team Contributions

- **Micah Baldonado**  
  - Proposed and conceptualized the AI Emotional Companion

  - Implemented the final AI Companion system and conducted evaluation of its performance  
  - Integrated system components into a cohesive demonstration

- **Aryaman Shandilya**  
  - Developed and trained the Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model used to classify user emotions  
  - [Link to SER model training data and implementation](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1cAXtTGNGEGbsgpigPVp6YhzpltJeV2OA)

- **Prajwal**  
  - Built the Streamlit web application that serves as the user-facing interface for the AI Emotional Companion

- **Peter Ragone**  
  - Assisted in compiling and writing the final project report

## About the Project

The AI Emotional Companion system is designed to detect emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise based on user speech input. Once an emotional state is recognized, the AI responds empathetically through a web-based application, showcasing how emotional intelligence can be incorporated into AI interactions.

The project highlights the potential of combining emotion recognition and dynamic response systems to create more human-like AI companions.

### Notes
- The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model was trained separately by Aryaman Shandilya, with data and training materials available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1cAXtTGNGEGbsgpigPVp6YhzpltJeV2OA).
- Future iterations could explore deeper integration of emotional recognition modules directly into the AI Companion framework.
