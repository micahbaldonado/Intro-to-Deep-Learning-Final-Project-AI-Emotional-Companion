Social phobia is a strong fear of being judged by others and of being embarrassed. This fear can be so strong that it gets in the way of going to work or school or doing other everyday things. Everyone has felt anxious or embarrassed at one time or another. For example, meeting new people or giving a public speech can make anyone nervous. But people with social phobia worry about these and other things for weeks before they happen. People with social phobia are afraid of doing common things in front of other people. For example, they might be afraid to sign a check in front of a cashier at the grocery store, or they might be afraid to eat or drink in front of other people, or use a public restroom. Most people who have social phobia know that they shouldn\u2019t be as afraid as they are, but they can\u2019t control their fear. Sometimes, they end up staying away from places or events where they think they might have to do something that will embarrass them.

A doctor can tell that a person has social phobia if the person has had symptoms for at least 6 months. Without treatment, social phobia can last for many years or a lifetime. \u2022 \u001a \u2022 \u001a \u2022 \u001a \u2022 \u001a \u2022 \u001a \u2022 \u001a \u2022 \u001a \u2022 \u001a What are the signs and symptoms of social phobia?

First, talk to your doctor about your symptoms.Your doctor should do an exam to make sure that another physical problem isn\u2019t causing the symptoms.The doctor may refer you to a mental health specialist. Social phobia is generally treated with psychother apy, medication, or both. Psychotherapy. A type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavior therapy is especially useful for treating social phobia. It teaches a person different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations that help him or her feel less anxious and fearful. It can also help people learn and practice social skills. Medication. Doctors also may prescribe medication to help treat social phobia.The most commonly prescribed medications for social phobia are anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants.Anti-anxiety medications are powerful and there are different types. Many types begin working right away, but they generally should not be taken for long periods. Antidepressants are used to treat depression, but they are also helpful for social phobia.They are probably more commonly prescribed for social phobia than anti-anxiety medications. Antidepressants may take several weeks to start working. Some may cause side effects such as headache, nausea, or difficulty sleeping.These side effects are usually not a problem for most people, especially if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you may have. A type of antidepressant called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are especially effective in treating social phobia. However, they are rarely used as a first line of treatment because when MAOIs are combined with certain foods or other medicines, dangerous side effects can occur. It\u2019s important to know that although antidepres sants can be safe and effective for many people, they may be risky for some, especially children, teens, and young adults.A \u201cblack box\u201d\u2014the most serious type of warning that a prescription drug can have\u2014has been added to the labels of anti depressant medications.These labels warn people that antidepressants may cause some people to have suicidal thoughts or make suicide attempts.
