Helen Avnet, Director of Re\u00ad search, G roup H ealth Insurance C om pany, revealed the results of a project that lasted two and one-half years, in which a panel of 1,139 psychiatrists treated patients on a short-term basis. O n termination, 70 percent of the p a\u00ad tients were rated by the panel as improved or recovered. It was concluded that a large por\u00ad tion of the c o m m u n ity \u2019s psychiatric needs could be met by short-term treatments. Jules M asserm an detailed the historical-comparative and experimental roots of short-term therapy, tracing its origins in the past. Sandor Rado presented material on motivational factors that could provide guidelines for techniques in short-term therapy. Paul Hoch differentiated the characteristics of short-term versus long\u00ad term therapy."}

Molly H arro w er described a research project related to outcome of long\u00ad term and short-term therapy. Arlene W olberg discussed the incorporation of case-work proce\u00ad dures in a short-term program . I gave two lec\u00ad tures, one on general aspects of technique and the other on the employment of hypnosis as an adjunct in short-term therapy. T h e sem inar was published later by G ru n e & Stratton under the title Short-term Psychotherapy. It is interesting in reviewing the current literature that independent studies have vali\u00ad dated an astonishingly large percentage of the ideas and observations of this seminar. It is relatively recently, however, that there has been a swing tow ard short-term therapy as a prim ary and preferred treatm ent rather than as an expedient. Even national psychoanalytic organizations, strongholds of long-term treat\u00ad ment, have begun to preach its virtues and have organized continuing-education courses on the subject. A host of articles and a num ber of interesting books have appeared, outlining philosophies, goals, selection procedures and techniques that the authors have found valua\u00ad ble in their attem pts to abbreviate treatm ent. In the main, similarities of concepts have ex\u00ad ceeded differences. Nevertheless, a great n u m \u00ad ber of questions rem ain unansw ered, and it is the purpose of the present volume to contribute to the resolution of some of these. O ne of the most critical questions is related to the value of dynamic approaches in short\u00ad term therapy. M ost importantly, can we em pi\u00ad rically prove the effectiveness of a dynamically based short-term therapy? Controlled experi\u00ad ments have been few, and even in these the dif\u00ad ficulties that shadow outcome studies tend to obscure results. Yet with all our skepticism about quantifying brief clinical operations suf\u00ad ficiently to satisfy the criteria of objectivity, validity, and reliability so essential in scientific studies, discrim inating experience establishes beyond reasonable doubt the usefulness of a dynamic orientation in any form of short-term psychotherapy. T h is applies w hether we are helping a person recognize and then to come to terms with his past, as in insight therapy, or eliminating effects of the past through rein\u00ad forcement of adaptive behaviors, as in behavior therapy, or squeezing the past out of muscles and tissues as in the \u201c new body therapies,\u201d or vii viii HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY gaining a perspective on inner emotional ef\u00ad fects of the past through sensory awareness techniques, or correcting habitual past modes of thinking, as in cognitive therapy.

In this volume I have attempted to bring together common elements in the chief models of short-term therapy currently in use and to evolve principles that can be employed by indi\u00ad vidual therapists, irrespective of their theo\u00ad retical biases and styles of operation. H ow a dynam ic view point m ay practically be in \u00ad troduced in any form of psychotherapy is one of my goals. T h e short-term method that I will describe is not presented with illusion that it is flawless, infallible, or universally applicable. N or may it prove equally helpful to all thera\u00ad pists or curative in every case. It is, neverthe\u00ad less, in my opinion, (and in the judgm ent of therapists who have utilized the method), an easily learned and effective technique servicea\u00ad ble for the great majority of patients seen in clinics and private practice. T h e method also takes into consideration the fact that there will be patients who are not good subjects for short-term treatm ent and who will require other forms of help. U nder these circum\u00ad stances, the method will function as a useful initial diagnostic procedure, enabling the thera\u00ad pist to select modalities that will serve the p a\u00ad tient best. T h e method also contains a means of p ro \u00ad viding co ntinu ing th era p y for the patien t through assigned homework and the use of a casette tape, the making of which will be described in detail. It has always confounded me that so m any therapists assume that when the last formal treatm ent session has ended, the patient can sally forth like the fabled prince and princess to live happily ever after. T h e facts on the follow-up are a grim denial of this fantasy. For example, in follow-up re\u00ad search of patients who had been treated in a comparison study with two forms of brief psy\u00ad chotherapy (behavior therapy and psychoana- lytically oriented p sych otherap y) and w ho were discharged as improved, Patterson, et al (1977) found that one year after termination, fully 60 percent had sought out and obtained further treatm ent. These figures are probably low because m any discharged patients w ho do not seek formal therapy utilize other forms of help or self-help to reduce their tension and better their adjustment. Life, after satisfactory psy ch o th erap eu tic tre a tm e n t, continues to present a never ending series of challenges that can tax coping capacities of even \u201c cured\u201d p a \u00ad tients. T his is not altogether bad, for in m eet\u00ad ing these challenges the individual has an op\u00ad portunity of strengthening adaptive patterns, much like a booster shot can enhance the effect of a prior vaccination.

As a handbook, this volume provides an out\u00ad line of process in short-term therapy. Should extensive details of technique be sought, they may be found elsewhere, including the third edition of my book The Technique o f P sy\u00ad chotherapy. It is recommended that the reader if not already acquainted w ith some techniques other than individual psychotherapy experi\u00ad ment with these to see w hether they accord with one\u2019s individual styles of working. In my opinion, a therapist\u2019s usefulness is especially enhanced by knowledge of group therapy (see The Technique o f Psychotherapy, 3rd ed, pp. 7 0 2 -7 2 9 ), fam ily th era p y (pp. 7 2 9 -7 3 3 ), marital (couple) therapy (pp. 733-740), be\u00ad havior therapy (pp. 685-701), relaxation pro\u00ad cedures (pp. 761-766), and somatic therapy (pp. 767-789). O ther techniques may peri\u00ad odically be useful such as hypnosis (pp. 791 \u2014 809), sex therapy (pp. 809-817), and bib- liotherapy (pp. 817-833). It goes without say\u00ad ing that knowledge of the therapeutic process from the initial interview to term ination (pp. PREFACE ix 353-684; 743-758) and especially interview\u00ad ing techniques (pp. 360-382) are indispensi- ble. A final word of caution may be indicated. O ne should not assume that it is always possi\u00ad ble to duplicate or surpass with short-term a p \u00ad proaches w hat can be done with appropriately selected patients through longer-term treat\u00ad ment. But, for the great majority of people seeking help for emotional problems, the time element is not the most im portant variable in psychotherapy. T im e is too frequently con\u00ad sidered a magical device that acts like a de\u00ad tergent, washing away accumulated neurotic residues. It is assumed traditionally that the longer a patient rem ains in psychotherapy, the greater the benefits he will derive from it. Comm on practice, however, convinces that this is true only up to a certain point. Beyond such a point, resistances pile up in a disturbing num ber of patients, gains are neutralized, and a setback ensues. Peering into the causes of these misfortunes, we observe in therapy that goes on for too protracted a period an em erg\u00ad ing sense of helplessness that may be concealed by various reaction formations. T h e conse\u00ad quence is a sabotage of progress and ultimately an exacerbation of symptoms. T h e therapist then becomes for the patient a crutch; without whom independent steps are avoided. T h is is particularly the case in sicker patients whose dependency needs are hallm arks of their basic personality structure, or who have, because of persistent anxiety, lost their sense of mastery and distrust their own capacities to function. W hatever gains may accrue from any evolving insights are neutralized by the crippling influ\u00ad ence of the prolonged sheltered relationship. Playing a waiting game"}

T h is is not to depreciate economic and other practical rea\u00ad sons for abbreviating short-term therapy. But apart from cost effectiveness and the need to minister to the growing multitudes of people who seek help, dynamic short-term treatm ent is justified only if it can prove itself to be a truly useful means of dealing w ith emotional problems in the vast majority of cases.

N ew York, New York N ovember 1, 1979 CHAPTER 1 Models of Short-term Therapy Brief treatm ent is no newcomer on the psychotherapeutic scene. Chronicled in prim i\u00ad tive archives of earliest recorded history, p a r\u00ad ticularly in Egypt and Greece, are accounts of what we may consider species of short-term psychotherapy. In these ancient documents there are transcribed elaborate rituals to heal the afflicted, to solace troubled souls, and to assuage anguish and distress. Among such in\u00ad terventions are tranquilizing nostrums, bodily manipulations, trance incantations, persuasive suggestions, and even rudim ents of reinforce\u00ad ment therapy, emotional catharsis, and inter\u00ad pretation of fantasies and dreams. Elaborations of these therapies continue to this day draped in the sophistication of modern theories. U p to the beginning of the twentieth century methods of treatm ent were short term; even the original Freudian techniques were implemented over a period of a few months. G radually psychoana\u00ad lytic methods stretched out in time, and the num ber of weekly sessions increased as efforts were directed at the task of resolving resistance to unconscious conflict. A few contemporaries of Freud, notably Adler, Ferenczi, Stekel, and R ank, tried heroically to shorten the p ro\u00ad tracted time of psychoanalysis, but their m eth\u00ad ods were repudiated by the official analytic es\u00ad tablishment. Some R ankian and Stekelian stra- tegems survived, nevertheless, and have been adapted to fit in with present-day styles and contem porary ideologies. Psychoanalytic Modifications in Brief Dynamic Therapy It was Franz Alexander in 1946 who most strikingly challenged the validity of prolonged time as a necessary component of treatm ent"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_5", "text": "methods directed at reconstructive goals. Reac\u00ad tion to A lexander\u2019s unorthodoxy was at first harsh, and although he was accused of aban \u00ad doning the psychoanalytic ship, it is to his credit that he resisted recanting his convictions. Along with French he published a pioneer work on brief therapy (Alexander & French, 1946) that questioned many of the assumptions of long-term classical psychoanalysis. In their volume the authors describe experi\u00ad menting with varying the frequency of inter\u00ad views, the alternative use of the chair and couch, deliberate interruptions of treatm ent p rio r to te rm in a tio n , strategic p lay ing of studied roles, and combined use of psychother\u00ad apy with drug and other treatm ents. At the time their experiments were considered as d a r\u00ad ing and innovative. Particularly regarded as aberrant were the emphasis on problem solv\u00ad ing and the consideration of therapy as a cor\u00ad rective emotional experience that functioned to break up old reaction patterns. \u201c In some cases,\u201d they wrote, \u201c the development of a full- fledged transference neurosis may be desir\u00ad able; in others it should perhaps be avoided altogether. In some it is im perative that emotional discharge and insight take place gradually; in others, with patients whose ego strength is greater, interviews with great emo\u00ad 1 2 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY tional tension may be not only harmless but highly desirable. All this depends upon the needs of the patient in a particular phase of the th erapeu tic p ro c e d u re .\u201d T h e m odifications suggested were forms of psychoanalysis based on dynamic principles that attem pt to secure a more harm onious environmental adjustm ent with enhanced development of one\u2019s capacities.

Indeed, regressive material w as usually a sign of neu\u00ad rotic w ithdraw al from a difficult life situation. It was the duty of the therapist to divert this retreat toward new attempts to solve problems from which the patient had fled in the past. Another disadvantage of too frequent sessions was that transference was not allowed to accu\u00ad mulate, being drained off in small quantities at each session, thus lessening the emotional p a r\u00ad ticipation.

T h e patient during the course of his experimenting with new patterns w as to be forewarned of failures and the need to analyze the reasons for these should they occur, thus turning them to advan\u00ad tage. W ith the development of community mental health facilities and the servicing of increasing groups of patients by staffs depleted through shrinking budgets, the necessity of limiting time devoted to treatm ent without destroying its effectiveness has rekindled interest in the observations of Alexander and French. Moreover, restriction of paym ents to a des\u00ad ignated num ber of sessions by insurance com\u00ad panies has forced even those therapists who by training and conviction are dedicated to long\u00ad term therapy to modify their tactics and to bring treatm ent to a halt w ithin the confines of the alloted reim bursem ent term. Economics has thus had a corrosive effect on ideology, which is probably all to the good in a field w here bias and opinion have frozen profes\u00ad sionals to postulates that could never have been otherwise thaw ed out and revised. T h e work of Alexander and French p ro \u00ad vided the foundation for other developing sys\u00ad tem s of d y nam ic sh o rt-term th erap y and inspired a num ber of analysts w ho though loyal to the teachings of Freud refused to con\u00ad sider them as divine revelations (M arm or, 1979). W hile challenging classical analytic concepts, they vouchsafed the validity of the dynamic design. A mong the best known of con\u00ad tem porary contributions to dynamic short-term therapy are the writings of M alan , Sifneos, and M ann . In th e study by M a la n (1963) at the T av isto ck C linic in L o n d o n , the p atien ts treated were those who were able to explore their feelings and who gave the impression they could w ork with interpretive therapy. All of the therapists involved were psychoana- lytically oriented and willing to employ an active interpretive technique. Sessions totaled from 10 to 40. It was possible, M alan wrote, under these conditions \u201c to obtain quite far- reaching improvements not merely in sym p\u00ad toms, but also in neurotic behavior patterns in patients w ith relatively extensive and long standing neuroses.\u201d T h e best results were achieved when (1) the patient was highly moti\u00ad vated, (2) the therapist demonstrated high en\u00ad thusiasm, (3) transference developed early, especially negative transference, and was inter\u00ad preted, and (4) grief and anger became im por\u00ad tant issues as term ination approached.

T h e technique if properly used car\u00ad ried few dangers, even where penetrating in\u00ad terp retatio n s w ere m ade from d ream s, fantasies, and the therapist-parent link of the transference that connected the present with childhood experiences. M alan modestly sug\u00ad gested that a crucial ingredient in change might not be the technique employed, but the nonspecific factor of the analyst ap ply in g himself enthusiastically to his technique ir\u00ad respective of w hether it was analytic or non- analytic. In a later study published in his book Frontier of B rief Psychotherapy, M alan (1976) confirmed his previous conclusions regarding the utility of dynamic short-term therapy and described some principles of selection of suita\u00ad ble patients for this form of treatm ent. In M a la n \u2019s sample the patients were carefully screened. Chosen were those who appeared \u201c to have the basic strength to stand up to uncover\u00ad ing psychotherapy,\u201d \u201c who were responsive to interpretation,\u201d and who could help formulate a circumscribed focus around which therapy could be done. Severity of pathology or chronicity were not considered. O f all factors in prognosis, motivation for insight and the ability to focus on significant material seemed to be of prim ary importance. These were con\u00ad sidered to be measures of successful interac\u00ad tions between patient and therapist. Patients who were excluded were alcoholics, homosex\u00ad uals, drug addicts, those who had at one time made serious suicidal attempts, who had a pe\u00ad riod of long-term hospitalization, who had more than one course of E C T , who suffered from in capacitating chronic obsessional or phobic sym ptom s, and w ho w ere grossly destructive or self-destructive in acting-out. As was predicted, reasons for rejection were that the patient would have difficulty in making contact, that a great deal of work would be needed to develop proper motivation for ther\u00ad apy, that rigid and deep-seated issues required more work than the limited time could allow, that severe dependence and other unfavor\u00ad able intense transference feelings would be too obstructive, or that depressive or psychotic disturbances might be precipitated or inten\u00ad sified. Sifneos (1972), confirming m any of M a la n \u2019s findings, adds some other criteria of selection for this form of dynamic \u201c anxiety-provoking\u201d therapy that lasts from 2 to 12 months. Suit\u00ad able p atien ts are those w ho possess five qualities: (1) existence of above-average in\u00ad telligence, (2) possession of at least one m ean\u00ad ingful relationship in the past, (3) ability to in teract w ith the initial interv iew er w hile manifesting appropriate emotions and a degree of flexibility, (4) ability to identify a specific chief complaint, (5) willingness to understand oneself, to w ork on oneself, to recognize one\u2019s symptoms as psychological, to be"}

For patients w ho are selected, sessions are held once weekly for 45 minutes in face-to-face interviews. T h e initial interview deals with history taking, particularly \u201c a judicious con\u00ad frontation by open-ended and forced-choice type of questions.\u201d As areas of conflict and m aladaptive reactions open up, the therapist asks questions that will give him a clearer pic\u00ad ture of the psychodynamics.

Interpretations help cla\u00ad rify the patient\u2019s reactions. Awareness of his own countertransference is vital, and the thera\u00ad pist must make sure he is not using the patient to gratify his own needs. Repeatedly dem on\u00ad strating how the patient deals with his conflicts and the adverse effects on him, the therapist acts as \u201c an unemotionally involved teacher.\u201d Tangible evidence of progress is shown by the patient\u2019s ability to relate w hat is going on to past sources and by improvement in his inter\u00ad personal relationships.

A diagnosis is made, and there is an assessment of the patient\u2019s general psy\u00ad chological state. T h ere is then an estimate of how 12 hour sessions should be distributed: 12 full sessions once weekly, 24 half-hour sessions over 24 weeks, or 48 sessions of 15 minutes over 48 weeks. T h e therapist expresses to the patient his opinion of the patient\u2019s chief prob\u00ad lem and w hat he believes should be done. H e consults his calendar and announces the exact date of termination. H e settles dates and times of appointm ents and discusses the fee. H e assures the patient that if they find the chosen central issue erroneous, they will move on to another issue. T h e patient is then given the privilege to accept or reject the stated condi\u00ad tions. Assuming that the patient has sufficient ego strength to negotiate a treatm ent agree\u00ad ment and to tolerate a structured schedule, a r \u00ad rangements for therapy are concluded. T h e interviews are conducted on as high an emotional level as possible, moving from ad ap \u00ad tive issues to defenses to genetic origins of con\u00ad flicts. This, of course, requires that the thera\u00ad pist be empathic and that he have a high degree of comprehension of dynamics. T h e choice of the central issue will vary with the th e ra p ist\u2019s u n d e rstan d in g and experience.

M an n advises not to compromise the 12- session time limit by m aking any promises to continue therapy after the allotted period has ended. In this way a fixed time structure is presented to the patient in which the d ram a of establishing a dependent relationship and of working through the crisis of separation and achievement of autonom y is repeated in a set\u00ad ting that permits a more satisfactory solution than the individual realized in his past early relationships. In other words, we are provided w ith two themes in therapy: the first, the central issue for which the patient seeks treat\u00ad ment, and the second, the more basic separa\u00ad tion-individuation theme.

As to selection of patients for this type of therapy, according to M ann , most patients are candidates except those with borderline or psy\u00ad chotic problems. Young people in a m atura- tional crisis have difficulties \u201c exquisitely re\u00ad lated to the separation-individuation process.\u201d Regarding therapists who can work with this method, M a n n says: \u201c It is evident that this kind of psychotherapy requires a high degree of skill, knowledge, and experience. K now l\u00ad edge of the psychoanalytic theories of mental functioning heavily buttressed by experience in the long-term treatm ent of patients is the first preparation for this treatm ent p lan .\u201d Another system of dynamic short-term ther\u00ad apy is described by Lewin (1970), who, follow\u00ad ing the lead of B ergler (1949), considers symptoms a consequence of psychic m asoch\u00ad ism, w hich is a universal ing redien t of neuroses. T h e need to appease guilt through suffering, he avows, can prevent progress in therapy. \u201c Ideally, the core of the patien t\u2019s masochism, his bad introject, should be ex\u00ad posed and replaced, along with his sadistic conscience.\u201d W hile this may not always be possible, the least the therapist can do is to confront the patient w ith his m asochism . Assigning all of his problems and symptoms to self-punishment for guilt feelings in relation to parental figures provides the patient with a focus that, according to Lewin, helps shorten the therapeutic process. Eclectic Systems Spurred on by community need, by stric\u00ad tures on the num ber of sessions financed by third-party payments, and by dissatisfaction with the results of long-term treatm ent, thera\u00ad pists of all denominations have experimented with briefer methods and contributed writings to short-term theory and practice. Some of the techniques are a revival of the methods em \u00ad ployed in the preanalytic and early analytic period. Some are replicas of established case\u00ad work and counseling procedures. O thers are more innovative, being influenced by behavior therapy, by the contem porary emphasis on ego functions, by an increasing interest in problem solving as a prim ary means of enhancing adaptation, as well as by a resurgent flexible eclecticism (Grayson, 1979). Accordingly, a num ber of models of short-term therapy have been introduced, and some of these will be cited as examples. O ther excellent models u n \u00ad doubtedly exist, but they cannot be included because of lack of space. An example of how MODELS OF SHORT-TERM THERAPY 7 florid the writings have become in short-term therapy is the annotated bibliography of Wells (1976), who in reviewing the literature up to 1974 details 243 citations covering m ajor journals in psychiatry, psychology, and social w ork.

T h e literature is replete with descriptions of special techniques vaunted by the authors as un iqu ely effective for sh o rt-te rm therap y. T h eir enthusiasm is understandable because therapists become skilled in certain methods to which they are by personality, operational style, and theoretical bias attuned. Lest we be\u00ad come too rhapsodic over any set of methods, however, we must rem em ber that while they may be effective in the hands of some, they may not be useful for all therapists. M atching patient and method is also a challenging prob\u00ad lem (Burke et al, 1979). Except for a few syn\u00ad dromes, such as behavior therapy for phobias and pharm acotherapy for psychoses, outcome studies fail to credit any special interventions with global superiority over other approaches. Indeed, statistics indicate equivalent improve\u00ad 8 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY ment rates for a host of available techniques.

Short-Term Therapy in Outpatient Clinics T h e urgency in many clinics to alter tactics of psychotherapy in line w ith the requirem ents of the patients being treated as well as the dis\u00ad position of the community has resulted in the shifting from long-term tre a tm e n t to w ard eclectic short-term programs. For example, at the M ontreal General Hospital in C anada a change in the treatm ent philosophy away from the long-term objective of personality recon\u00ad struction was necessary for practical reasons: (1) because the kind of patient population the clinic dealt with was unable to utilize a prolonged therapeutic relationship and (2) be\u00ad cause some of the therapists were not fittingly trained or were unable to spend a sufficiently long time to follow through with appropriate treatm ent measures (Davanloo, 1978; Straker, 1968). T h e result was a \u201c high dropout rate or the rapid development of chronic clinic de\u00ad pendency.\u201d In addition, waiting lists became so great that acute emotional crises could not receive needed help. A brief psychotherapy program was started in 1961 based on psy\u00ad chodynamic formulations. Patients who did 10 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY not qualify for the program received support- tive kinds of help, pharm acotherapy, social service assistance, w ard care, and so on, ac\u00ad cording to their needs. W ith this pragm atic change the dropout rate decreased over five times, and staff interest and morale were greatly stren gth en ed. F o llo w -u p studies 2 years after intake revealed that 66 percent of the total case load had benefited sufficiently to need no further therapy. Patients selected for and treated with brief psychotherapy showed an 84 percent remission rate. Largely through D avanloo\u2019s efforts three International Symposia were organized, in 1975, 1976, and 1977, bringing together pro\u00ad fessionals interested in brief approaches. D avanloo\u2019s methods resemble those of Sifneos and M alan. Evaluation criteria for dynamic therapy are, first, the assay of the ability to es\u00ad tablish meaningful relationships based on the patient\u2019s having had previous emotional ties with other people. Even in the first interview the patient\u2019s capacity to interact with the ther\u00ad apist will be obvious. Second, there is an esti\u00ad mate of the ego\u2019s capacity to experience and tolerate anxiety that will be mobilized in the interview. T h ird, motivation for true change must be differentiated from a desire to satisfy an infantile need in therapy. Fourth, psycho\u00ad logical mindedness and capacity for introspec\u00ad tion are judged carefully. Fifth, the most cru\u00ad cial criterion is the patient\u2019s ability to respond constructively to in terp re tatio n d u rin g the evaluation interview. Sixth, the degree of in\u00ad telligence is an im portant factor in the choice of approach. Seventh, the evaluator must de\u00ad termine the richness"}

D avanloo is wedded to classical analytic formulations, such as the structural hypothesis, and frames his language in these terms. T here is general agreement among most therapists with D avan\u00ad loo\u2019s belief that selection of a psychothera\u00ad peutic focus is vital in short-term therapy and that \u201c identification and understanding of the psychodynamics and psychological processes underlying the patient\u2019s psychological pro b\u00ad lems is the key issue in the evaluation process.\u201d O ther clinics that have remodeled the struc\u00ad ture of their services along short-term lines also report an improved remission rate among patients and a heightened staff moral. T h e num ber of sessions devoted to treatm ent is con\u00ad sidered arbitrary and has tended to cluster around lower limits, which in some studies have yielded results equal to treatm ent with nu m erically high er sessions. E rre ra et al (1967) com pared the results of patients at the Yale-New Haven M edical Center Psychiatric O utpatient Clinic who were in therapy for from 6 to 10 sessions with a similar population who received 21 or more treatm ent sessions and found that \u201c there was no significant differ\u00ad ence in the improvement rates, neither as recorded by the therapists nor evaluated by the raters.\u201d Lingering doubts as to the extent of help p a \u00ad tients receive has been all but dissipated by the experience of clinics that have converted their services along short-term lines and conducted follow-up inquiries. At the Boston University Medical C enter Psychiatric Clinic, for ex\u00ad ample, a study was conducted by Haskell et al (1969) as to w hat happened to patients after 12 weeks in short-term therapy. Significant changes were found in the group as a whole (about 71 percent) on five measures of de\u00ad pression, anxiety, and overall improvement.

Four to eight individual sessions are given. If more therapy is needed, maximal use is made of group and family therapy. Professionals from different disciplines are used, including psy\u00ad chiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric social workers, and psychiatric nurses. An experi\u00ad enced therapist may be accompanied by a ther\u00ad apist in training, who participates as an ob\u00ad server. T h u s the session operates as a training tool. Indications for referring a patient to a psychiatrist therapist are any of the following: (1) somatic symptoms, (2) mental illness in a patient who is dangerous to himself or others, (3) a need for medications, (4) history of at\u00ad tempted or threatened suicide, or (5) a special request for a psychiatrist. T h e a p p ro ach utilized is dynamically oriented and is not con\u00ad sidered, in the words of Gelb and Allman (1967) \u201c an emergency shortcut or a poor sub\u00ad stitute for an unattainable ideal but is, in itself, the most effective and h um an approach to our patients. . . .\u201d Immediate, active, em phatic and accurate confrontation with neurotic function\u00ad ing is more effective than \u201c years of passive w orking-through.\u201d Patients w ho require more help after therapy ends are invited to return \u201c anytime the need arises,\u201d but not on a con\u00ad tinuing basis. T his approach has resulted in a 60 percent improvement rate within five visits. T his improvement rate, that is about two- thirds of the patients receiving therapy, is substantiated by many other walk-in clinics (Gottschalk et al, 1967; Jacobson & W ilner, 1965). In a large study of over 8,000 patients treated on an emergency basis only 10 percent req u ired con tin u in g lon g-term th e ra p y (Coleman & Zwerling, 1959). T h e value of short-term group crisis intervention has also been demonstrated. In a study of 78 cases receiving six group sessions compared with 90 control cases in unlimited groups or individual therapy, the short-term group cases dem on\u00ad strated greater improvement on a 5-point scale of functioning (T rakas & Lloyd, 1971). W alk-in clinics designed to provide im \u00ad m ediate goal-lim ited help (B eliak, 1964; Colem an & Zwerling, 1959; Jacobson et al, 1965; N orm and et al, 1967; Peck et al, 1966) generally concern themselves with crisis inter\u00ad vention"}

Al\u00ad though the w ork-up done in different clinics will vary, it generally includes some dynamic formulation of the problem, an assay of exist\u00ad ing ego strengths and weaknesses, and an esti\u00ad m ate of the degree of pathogenicity of the cur\u00ad rent environment. T o w ard this end N orm and et al (1967) have described a joint initial inter\u00ad 12 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY view conducted by a psychiatrist-social worker team. Such a team maximizes the selection of an approach to the existing problem and outlines a blueprint for action. A working hy\u00ad pothesis is formulated attem pting to relate intrapsychic a n d /o r environmental aspects to the disturbed behavior or the symptoms, and it is around this hypothesis that choice of inter\u00ad ventions is made from a wide range of sup\u00ad portive, educational, and insight-oriented ap \u00ad proaches. Should no improvement occur, the working hypothesis is reformulated. T h is a p \u00ad proach has proven itself to be practical \u201c as an aid to providing high quality mental health services for the poor\u201d in the face of even overw helm ingly im possible en viro nm en tal deprivations.

W alk-in clinics thus provide a vital need in the practice of comm unity psychiatry by m ak\u00ad ing treatm ent immediately and easily accessible to all classes of patients. M an y problems can be managed through this means that otherwise would go unattended. O n the basis of an anal\u00ad ysis of many interviews in the psychiatric walk-in clinic of the M assachusetts General Hospital in Boston, which handles about 40 walk-in patients each day (15,000 visits per year), L azare et al (1972) have listed 14 cate\u00ad gories of patients. 1.

Should he bypass the p atien t\u2019s immediate plea for help or probe for conflicts and other dy\u00ad namic forces underlying the request, therapy may never get started. Obviously, fulfilling the patient\u2019s desire alone may not get to the bot\u00ad tom of the patient\u2019s troubles, but it will be an avenue through which one will be able to coor\u00ad dinate and utilize the data gathered in the diagnostic evaluating interview. In clinics or private therapy where there is lack of con\u00ad gruence between w hat the patient seeks and what the therapist decides to provide, the dropout rate after the first interview is1 as high as 50 percent (Borghi, 1968; H eine & T rosm an, 1960).

Recognition of these facts has led to some crisis intervention program s to provide short\u00ad term help for the bereaved in the service of both prevention and rehabilitation (Gerber, 1969; Silver et al, 1957; P.

Dealing with Unresponsive Patients Despite our best efforts to shorten therapy there will be some patients who will need con\u00ad tinuing treatment. Clinics only too often be\u00ad come clogged with such chronic patients whose tre atm e n t becomes interm inab le. T h is can result in long waiting lists and an end to ready access to therapy for even emergency prob\u00ad lems. T h is is not to depreciate the value of pro\u00ad longed treatm ent in some long-standing emo\u00ad tional problems. However, from a pragm atic standpoint, for the great majority of chronic patients other modes of m anagem ent are not only helpful, but actually are more attuned to the continuing needs of these patients. Such al\u00ad 14 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY ternative methods involve, perhaps for the re\u00ad mainder of a patient\u2019s life, occasional short (10- to 15-minute) visits with a professional person on a monthly or bimonthly basis, supervision of drug intake, introduction into a group (therapeutic, social, or rehabilitative), and u tilization of a p p ro p ria te com m unity resources. W hat the therapist tries to avoid for such a patient is stimulating dependency on himself personally. An eight-year experiment at an outpatient clinic dedicated to the therapy of the chron\u00ad ically ill at the University of Chicago H os\u00ad pitals and Clinics is reported by Rada et al (1969). T h e clinic is open every T hursday afternoon for 2 /i hours, patients being seen in order of arrival. Patients are accepted only after a diagnostic evaluation and initial w ork\u00ad up by the referral sources to make sure they will be suitable for the clinic routines. T he staffing is by psychiatric residents, medical students, a social worker, receptionist, and two attending staff supervisory psychiatrists, the latter four being the only perm anent staff. U pon arrival, the receptionist greets the pa\u00ad tie n t\u2014 and if they come, the fam ily\u2014 and brings the patient into the waiting room, where light refreshments (cookies and coffee) are served. P atien t interactions are en \u00ad couraged. Individual interviews are for 15 to 25 minutes to ascertain the present physical and emotional state, to regulate the drug in\u00ad take if drugs are taken, to offer recom m enda\u00ad tions for intervening activities, and to make an appointm ent for the next time. T h e patients are then returned to the waiting area for more coffee and socialization. Family and couples therapy are done if necessary. Frequency of visits range from weekly sessions to once every 6 months although patients may return volun\u00ad tarily if they need help. Should the patient drop out of therapy, he is perm itted to return in times of stress without having to go through a readmission procedure. After the clinic hours the staff meets briefly (30 to 45 minutes) to dis\u00ad cuss the d a y \u2019s problems."}

Diagnostic categories vary, approxi\u00ad mately half being psychotic, the rem ainder hav\u00ad ing severe neuroses and personality disorders. Fees generally support the clinic and are rela\u00ad tively low. Short-term Hospitalization and Its Alternatives Shrinking budgets have made it mandatory to take a hard look at costs versus benefits not only in regard to psychotherapy, but also protracted psychiatric hospitalization. A part from p rag m atic disadvantages or im p racti- calities of cost/benefits, prolonged in s titu \u00ad tionalization fosters regression and paralyzing dependencies\u2014 plus extended separation from com m unity life. T h ese u n fo rtu an te co n tin \u00ad gencies have sponsored shifts from long-term confinement to short-term detention organized around the objective of early discharge. Al\u00ad ternatives to hospitalization have also been ex\u00ad plored. For example, in an experimental pro\u00ad gram Davis et al (1972) demonstrated that a team led by visiting nurses going to the homes of patients to oversee proper medication could prevent hospitalization and improve relation\u00ad ships within the family. Another example is the finding by Zwerling and W ilder (1962) that a day-care treatm ent facility could often act as an adequate substitute for an inpatient unit. T h ere are, nevertheless, situations when hospitalization is essential, for example, to provide security for disturbed or suicidal p a \u00ad tients or w h ere crisis-oriented th e ra p y is needed and it cannot be done on an outpatient basis. A limited hopsital stay may be all that is MODELS OF SHORT-TERM THERAPY 15 required. Even in children short-term hospital\u00ad ization is sometimes considered (Shafii et al, 1979). T h a t it is possible to reduce the time of hos\u00ad pitalization of patients admitted to an institu\u00ad tion through a crisis intervention program utilizing a wide range of treatm ent modalities has been demonstrated by Decker and Stub- blebine (1972) in a 2 ii year study of 315 young adults.

As for results, at the end of brief hospitalization of the first 100 patients, 18 percent were transferred for longer inpatient care after the 3-day intensive experi\u00ad ence since they required longer term hospitali\u00ad zation. Another 19 percent were rehospitalized within 1 year of discharge. At the 1-year follow-up routine almost two-thirds of all p a \u00ad tients had not been rehospitalized or trans\u00ad ferred after the 3-day intensive hospital treat\u00ad ment. T his compares favorably with rehospi\u00ad talization rates with longer term therapy. T h e function of the usual short-term hospi\u00ad talization (i.e., 3 to 4 weeks) is, first, to bring about a rapid remission of symptoms and, second, to prepare the patient for, and to see that there is made available, an adequate aftercare program . T h e first objective is ac\u00ad complished by drug therapy and E C T if neces\u00ad sary, individual family and group treatm ent, and milieu, occupational, and rehabilitative therapy, all tailored to the patient\u2019s needs. Be\u00ad cause of the em p hasis on the control of symptoms rather than alterations in the per\u00ad sonality structure, crisis-oriented behavioral approaches along eclectic lines are most com\u00ad monly practiced. Ideally, brief hospitalization should provide psychotherapy to prepare the patient for outpatient care (A. B. Lewis, 1973). T h e second objective, although most crucial to avoid the revolving door syndrome, is too often neglected. Unless the posthospi\u00ad tal environment is regulated, ensuing stress will almost inevitably produce a relapse in symptoms. A mong the measures necessary to prevent this are the adjustm ent of living a r\u00ad rangem ents so that the least strain is imposed on the patient\u2019s coping capacities, the use of halfway houses, facilities providing day and night care, supervised drug management, and rehabilitative, social, health, and recreational programs.

W here possible, the therapist who has worked with the patient in the hospital should be the one who continues seeing the patient and di\u00ad recting the aftercare program . Sometimes the hospital may provide some of the aftercare services, but the administrators should always strive to integrate the patient into the com m u\u00ad nity as rapidly as possible. T h is is usually the best course. W here return to a family would be disturbing\u2014 for instance, where members are too hostile, demanding, and rejecting\u2014 place\u00ad ment in a halfway house and later in a foster home may be advisable. Short-term hospitalization does not elimi\u00ad nate intermediate-term intensive treatm ent in a hospital, that is, 130 to 180 days, or for longer periods where the aim is a personality change. However, custodial care in patients who re\u00ad quire continuing managem ent can usually be achieved outside of a hospital facility. W ayne (1976) has appropriately pointed out that what determines the duration of hospitalization is not the diagnosis but the persistence of a habi\u00ad tual disruptive life-style, severe family, social, and occupational difficulties, and the presence of a serious physical disability or hypochon\u00ad driasis. W here the proper environment is made available and aftercare supervision promoted, even chronic psychotic persons can make an adjustment outside of an institution. T h ere is evidence that short-term family therapy can cut down the need for hospitaliza\u00ad tion in acute cases of decompensation.

O ther studies verify the utility of short-term group training for parents in managing problems in their children (G. R. Patterson et al, 1973a; W alter & Gilm ore, 1973; Wiltz & Patterson, 1974). M an y th era\u00ad pists believe that where the child is under 7 years of age the main therapeutic work is with the parents. From ages 7 to 11 the child and parents are seen separately. From 12 on family sessions seem best. Preadolescent children with acute problems have been materially helped by parent groups focused on discussions of child m anagement, pow er ploys of children, and al\u00ad ternate approaches to problem solving.

T h e time limit set is 6 weeks during which a m axim um of 12 sessions are arranged for the child and other family members. T h e child generally is ignorant of why he is actually seeing the th e ra\u00ad pist, has little real notion of his underlying problem, and no motivation to do anything about it.

M o re extensive therapy is required by 30 percent, and help other than psychotherapy (special classes, residential placement, etc.) is required by 20 percent. Short-term Group Approaches M anpow er shortages reinforced by the fac\u00ad tor of cost/benefit have accelerated the use of short-term group therapy, both for hospi\u00ad talized persons and outpatients. M an y group program s have accordingly been introduced, utilizing techniques that draw their substance from psychoanalysis, behavior therapy, cogni\u00ad tive therapy, guided imagery or any other theoretical school to which the therapists are dedicated. 1.

Short-term groups are usually open-ended and frequ ently conducted by co therap ists (G oolishian, 1962; Sadock et al, 1968; Shrader et al, 1969; T ra k as & Lloyd, 1971."}

T h e uses and abuses of groups are described by Im ber et al (1979). Short-term groups with children have been gaining popularity (G raham , 1976; Rosenthal & Levine 1970), some reports claiming suc\u00ad cesses equal to that in long-term therapy (Rosenthal & Levine, 1971). An example is the study by Burdon and Neely (1966) who treated 55 boys with repeated school failures. A 5-year follow-up showed increased school at\u00ad tendance with 98 percent passing and 73 per\u00ad cent earning promotions. Some useful methods for working w ith children in groups have been outlined by Rhodes (1973), Epstein (1976), and Levin & Rivelis (1970). Short-term group treatm ent may also be helpful for maladjusted adolescents (Eisenberg, 1975; Rivera & Bat- taggia, 1967), during brief inpatient care for adolescents (Chiles & Sanger, 1977; M oser, 1975), for delinquent adolescents (D anner & G am son, 1968), adolescent drug users (Deeths, 1970), and youthful offenders in a detention MODELS OF SHORT-TERM THERAPY 19 unit (W ould & Reed, 1974). T h e need to dis\u00ad tinguish between adolescents whose problems are the product of entanglements related to the developmental process and those whose en \u00ad counter with adolescence stirs up unresolved conflicts of earlier stages of growth will influ\u00ad ence techniques and objectives (Sprince, 1968). G ro up work with parents of problem chil\u00ad dren has also proven re w a rd in g (E p stein, 1970; M aizlish & H u rley , 1963; T ra cey , 1970), the training of parents in behavioral methods being especially popular as an effec\u00ad tive intervention method (Bijou & Redd, 1975; Ferber et al, 1974; Patterson, 1973a, 1973b, 1974; W alter & Gilm ore, 1973). O ne of the most difficult situations for the therapist is the unmotivated family of children with aggressive behavior disorders. A pilot study at the University of Chicago School of M edicine by Safer (1966) describes work with 29 such parents whose children ranged in age from 4 to 16. Family, conjoint and individual sessions produced improvement in most children, and this was maintained in follow-up evaluations after 4 to 16 months. T h e areas of change brought about by therapy in families w ith de\u00ad linquent adolescents has exposed some interest\u00ad ing findings. For example, Parsons and Alex\u00ad ander (1973) discovered that one could utilize in studies four interaction measures that were not a function of extraneous variables. M arital therapy is also often conducted on a short-term basis both in groups (Leiblum & Rosen, 1979; Wells, 1975) and with individual couples (Bellville et al, 1969; Fitzgerald, 1969; Kalina, 1974; P. A. M artin & Bird, 1963; P. A. M artin & Lief, 1973; Sager et al, 1968; Satir, 1965; Simon, 1978; W atzlaw ick et al, 1967). An interesting model is described by"}

H e has evolved an intensive 3- week approach resembling cognitive learning (Bakker & Bakker-R abdau, 1973) that em \u00ad phasizes confrontation and problem solving with the help of active, enthusiastic, facilita- tive therapists. O ther methods are outlined elsewhere (Wolberg, 1977, pp. 733-740). A num ber of reports have indicated that short-term m arital therapy is at least as effec\u00ad tive in dealing with m arital conflict as long\u00ad term therapy. G u rm a n (1975) reviewed avail\u00ad able data and found that a 76 percent improve\u00ad ment rate was achieved w ith an average of about 16 sessions. Review studies by Barten (1969), Reid and Epstein (1972); and Reid a nd Shyne (1969) confirm these positive results. Ratings at term ination and at an average of 2 Zi years later of 49 couples who were involved in conjoint m arital therapy (a comparison of these with reported results of outcome studies on individual short-term psy\u00ad chotherapy as well as with another form of conjoint therapy and with psychoanalysis) in\u00ad dicate that the conjoint approach has some technical advantages over and compares fa\u00ad vorably with these other types of treatm ent (Fitzgerald, 1969). Short-term family therapy continues to grow in popularity. Its techniques are described by B artoletti (19 69 a, 1969b), Bloch (1973), Deutsch (1966), Eisler and H erson (1973), H aley and Hoffman (1967), Fangsley and K aplan (1968), Pittm an et al (1966), Satir (1964a), and W atzlaw ick (1963). T h e num ber of sessions that are optimal for family therapy is dealt with in experimental evaluations by Stuart and T ripod i (1973). T h ey random ly assigned 73 families with predelinquent and delinquent adolescents to 15-, 45-, and 90-day behaviorally o rien ted tre atm en ts. O u tcom e measures showed no difference between the groups. T h u s it w as concluded that there is no reason to choose longer over shorter family treatments. T h e idea that brief family therapy yields superficial results is challenged by H aug (1971), w ho describes a case w here ego altera\u00ad tion coincided closely with rapid and persisting alterations in the body image. However, where the adaptive flexibility of parents is blocked by rigid defenses or the conflict in the child is m arkedly internalized, traditional longer term psychotherapeutic methods are probably more suitable (H aug, 1971). T h e combination of group and family th er\u00ad 20 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY apy appears to possess some advantages, as Kimbro et al (1967) and Durell (1969) have pointed out in their report of a pilot study of tim e-lim ited m ultiple fam ily th erap y w ith d isturbed adolescents and th eir fam ilies.

Massing Therapy Sessions Attempts have also been made to study the effect of massing therapy sessions by literally immersing the patient in treatm ent throughout the day. T h u s Swenson and M artin (1976) treated patients on a full-time basis for 3 weeks with combinations of different modalities that they considered com plem ented each other. Assessing the program on 335 patients at the time of discharge revealed significant improve\u00ad m ent in the presenting sym ptom s, w ork capacities, in terp erso n al relation sh ips, and general level of comfort. A follow-up study showed that this improvement was retained. \u201c Massed time-limit\u201d therapy sessions for as long as 10 hours consecutively have been given (Berenbaum et al, 1969).

G ro u p and individual therapy focused on m ajor dyn am ics and self-reh abilitatio n. Results were considered at least com parable to conventional psychotherapy. M arath o n group sessions (Bach, 1966, 1967 a-d ; Casriel & Deitch, 1968; T eicher et al, 1974; Vernallis et al, 1970, 1972) while not as popular as in previous years continue to have their advocates. Conclusion Somehow, short-term therapy has acquired the reputation of being a substandard a p \u00ad proach in which quality of results is sacrificed on the altar of expediency. Superficiality of goals, uncertainty of results, substitution of symptoms, and a general glossing over of ef\u00ad fects are said to be inevitable. T hese ideas have proven grossly inaccurate. T h ere is ample evi\u00ad dence from the reported clinical experiences with short-term therapy that it has a utility not only as an economic expedient, but also as a preferred form of psychiatric trea tm en t. W hatever controlled research studies exist, these substantiate its value in individual ther\u00ad apy with adults, adolescents and children, as well as in group, family and m arital therapy. A num ber of models of short-term therapy have evolved from which techniques may selec\u00ad tively be adapted to the working styles of psychotherapists trained in the various the\u00ad oretical orientations. T h e actual models in use are usually condi\u00ad tioned by the experience and theoretical orientation of the practicing professionals and the policies of the agencies, if any, under whose supervision the work is being done. T h e shortcomings of some of these systems is that they tend to be monolithic, circumventing fac\u00ad MODELS OF SHORT-TERM THERAPY 21 tors related to the"}

Not all persons are capable of utiliz\u00ad ing the techniques that are offered. T h is is not extraordinary since patients generally h arm o \u00ad nize with some interventions and not with others. Some do well with a cognitive ap \u00ad proach in which they can absorb abstract con\u00ad cepts and insights that help them to alter their sing ular th in k in g p attern s. O th e rs fail to benefit from such tactics. T h ey do better with behavioral techniques, experimenting with dif\u00ad ferent modes of action, solidifying successful ones though reinforcements. Still others learn by modeling themselves after an admired a u \u00ad thority, generally the therapist, bestowing on him virtues he may or may not possess. An ef\u00ad fective short-term therapist is one who discerns the needs and learning proclivities of each pa\u00ad tient and is flexible enough to alter his m eth\u00ad ods as he goes along. Rigid th erap ists doggedly follow a set agenda into which they wedge all patients with little room for eclectic maneuvering. Yet one hardly ever sees a patient who could not utilize some of the effective interventions of different systems at successive stages of their treatm ent. T h u s a therapist may with the same patient be active at some times and passive at others; he m ay selectively em ploy con fron tatio n, re \u00ad assurance, or suggestive or persuasive tech\u00ad niques. If familiar with the methods, he may utilize role playing, psychodrama, relaxation, hypnosis, fam ily th era p y , g ro u p th erap y , milieu th erap y , system atic d ensen sitizatio n, assertive training, and other behavioral tech\u00ad niques w hen necessary. H e m ay em ploy psychotropic drugs when symptoms block ef\u00ad fective learning. H e may utilize the lessons learned from psychoanalysis that help expose and resolve unconscious resistances, particu\u00ad larly transference and acting-out. Obviously for best results the therapist must be highly se\u00ad lective about the modalities he uses so that he does not sw am p the patient with unnecessary activity. All therapists cannot be expert in, or even aw are of, every available technique that exists. But sufficient flexibility should prevail to prevent a stalemate w hen the patient fails to respond to the method that the therapist is a p \u00ad plying at the moment. T h e fact that the various short-term ther\u00ad apies in the hands of competent therapists do bring about relief or cure indicates that the particular techniques and stratagems employed are not the only im portant elements responsi\u00ad ble for improvement. T h e proposition is invit\u00ad ing that therapeutic maneuvers merely act as a means of comm unication through which the therapist encourages the emergence of positive, and the resolution of negative, healing ele\u00ad ments (M arm o"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_34", "text": "r, 1966). If a therapist feels most comfortable with a more active approach than with a less active one, with hypnosis rather than formal interviewing, with behavior therapy rather than analytically oriented ther\u00ad apy, he will probably be able to help more p a \u00ad tients than were he to force himself to use a procedure with which he is not at ease or about which he is not enthusiastic. T h is is not to depreciate the virtues of any of the existing models and techniques. However, we do tend to overemphasize technical virtuosity while minim izing the vital healing processes that emerge in the course of the helping relation\u00ad ship as a h um an experience. CHAPTER 2 A Rationale for Dynamic Short-term Therapy S h ort-term th erap y generally has three goals: (1) modifying or removing the symptom complaint for which help is being sought, which is the immediate objective, (2) produc\u00ad ing some corrective influence on the indi\u00ad vidual\u2019s general adjustment, and (3) initiating essential alterations in the personality struc\u00ad ture. W ith p ro p erly conducted treatm en t we may anticipate substantial or complete symptom relief as well as some modification for the better of behavioral coping. However, we may scarcely have broken ground on the third goal of personality reconstruction. W e may hope, nevertheless, that the experience of treatm ent will have set into motion a process following therapy that over a long-term period will result in true character permutations. T h a t such changes do occur has been dem on\u00ad strated in follow-up studies of patients who have received appropriate professional help over a brief span. T h ou gh not anticipated, sig\u00ad nificant and lasting changes in the self-image and the quality of interpersonal relationships have been noted. W hen we review the m any systems of short\u00ad term therapy that address themselves to the goal of personality reconstruction, we find that the majority acknowledge the operation of unconscious conflict, along with the condition\u00ad ing of faulty habit responses, as a source of the neurotic process. In dynamic forms of therapy a prim e objective is helping the patient acquire greater knowledge of oneself including one\u2019s hidden motives. A question is w hether the kind of treatm ent being employed can lend itself to the achievement of this objective. Categories of Short-term Therapy T h ro u g h o u t the lite ratu re one finds a tendency to subdivide short-term therapy into three distinctive categories: (1) crisis interven\u00ad tion, (2) su pp ortiv e-ed ucation al sho rt-term therapy, and (3) dynamic short-term therapy. T h e goals of crisis intervention usually differ from those in the other brief methods. H ere, after from 1 to 6 sessions, an attem pt is made to restore habitual balances in the existing life situation. Supportive-educational approaches, such as behavior therapy, constitute forms of intervention that are undertaken, along with educational ind octrinatio n, to relieve or"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_35", "text": "remove symptoms, to alter family habit p at\u00ad terns, and to rectify behavioral deficits. T o at\u00ad tain these objectives, a variety of eclectic tech\u00ad niques are implemented, depending on the idosyncratic needs of the patient and the skills and methodological preferences of the th era\u00ad pist. T h e num ber of sessions varies, ranging from 6 to 25. In dynamic short-term therapy the thrust is tow ard achieving or at least start\u00ad ing a process of personality reconstruction. Sessions here may extend to 40 or more. Some forms of crisis intervention th at are being practiced are indistinguishable from the 22 RATIONALE FOR DYNAMIC SHORT-TERM THERAPY 23 kind of counseling commonly done in social agencies. T h e focus is on mobilizing positive forces in the individual to cope with the crisis situation, to resolve remediable environmental difficulties as rapidly as possible, utilizing if necessary appropriate resources in the com m u\u00ad nity, and to take whatever steps are essential to forestall future crises of a similar or related n a \u00ad ture. No attem pt is made at diagnosis or psychodynamic formulation. O ther kinds of crisis intervention attempt provisionally to de\u00ad tect underlying intrapsychic issues and past formative experiences and to relate these to current problems. M ore extensive goals than mere emotional stabilization are sought. T h e \u201c social-counseling\u201d forms of crisis in\u00ad tervention are generally employed in walk-in clinics and crisis centers where large numbers of clients apply for help and where there is a need to avoid getting involved too intimately with clients who might get locked into a de\u00ad pendent relationship. Visits are as frequent as can be arranged and are necessary during the first 4 to 6 weeks. T h e family is often involved in some of the interviews, and home visits may have to be made. T h e interview focus is on the present situational difficulty and often is con\u00ad cerned with the most adaptive ways of coping with immediate pressing problems. Vigorous educational measures are sometimes exploited to activate the patient. T h e employment of supportive measures and the use of other help\u00ad ing individuals and agencies is encouraged. T h e second, m ore am bitious, goal-directed forms of crisis intervention are often seen oper\u00ad ating in outpatient clinics and private practice. If the assigned num ber of sessions have been exhausted and the patient still requires more help, referral to a clinic or private therapist or continued treatm ent with the same therapist is considered. B rief su pp ortiv e-edu catio nal ap pro aches have sponsored a variety of techniques, such as traditional interviewing, behavior therapy, re\u00ad laxation, hypnosis, biofeedback, somatic ther\u00ad apy, G estalt therapy, sex therapy, group ther\u00ad apy, etc., singly or in combination. T h e nu m \u00ad ber of sessions will vary according to the indi\u00ad vidual therapist, who usually anchors his deci\u00ad sion on how long it takes to control symptoms and enhance adaptation. T"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_36", "text": "h e philosophy that enjoins therapists to employ dynamic short-term treatm ent is the conviction that m any of the derivatives of present behaviors are rooted in needs, conflicts, and defenses that reach into the past, often as far back as early childhood. Some of the most offensive of these components are unconscious, and while they obtrude themselves in officious and often destructive ways, they are usually ra \u00ad tionalized and shielded with a tenacity that is frustrating both to the victim and to those around him. T h e only way, according to pre\u00ad vailing theories, that one can bring these mischief m akers under control is to propel them into consciousness so that the patient realizes w hat he is up against. By studying how the patient utilizes the relationship with him, the therapist has an opportunity to de\u00ad tect how these buried aberrations operate, projected as they are into the treatm ent situa\u00ad tion. D ream s, fantasies, verbal associations, nonverbal behavior, and transference m ani\u00ad festations are considered appropriate media for exploration because they embody unconscious needs and conflicts in a symbolic form. By his training, the therapist believes himself capable of decoding these symbols. Since im portant unconscious determ inants shape one\u2019s everyday behavior, the therapist tries to establish a con\u00ad nection between the patient\u2019s present p er\u00ad sonality in operation, such as tem peram ent, moods, morals and m anners, with early past experiences and conditionings in order to help the patient acquire some insight into how prob\u00ad lems originated. 24 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY Universality of Dynamic Principles T h e subdivisions of short-term treatm ent that have been described\u2014 namely, crisis inter\u00ad vention, sup po rtive-edu catio nal sh o rt-term therapy, and dynamic short-term therapy\u2014 are artificial. In practice their boundaries become diffuse. Because patients respond selectively to different techniques, effective therapists in all three categories of treatm ent will vary their in\u00ad terventions according to the immediate prob\u00ad lems and needs of their patients. Moreover, be\u00ad cause all operate within the m atrix of a rela\u00ad tionship that develops between patients and th erapists, und erlyin g person ality problem s and conflicts will surface during therapy and yield vitally significant dynamic material for examination.

Indeed the techniques and interventions used by the therapist to influence the p a tie n t\u2019s sym ptom s m ay be less im portant than the fantasies and behavioral responses they evoke in the patient. For example, some manifesta\u00ad tions reflect projections of past fears and desires in relation to early authority figures. These, if undetected or disregarded, may effec\u00ad tively block therapeutic progress. Such tran s\u00ad ference resistances are extremely common and are probably the chief reason for failures in therapy.

A m an with emphysema who came to ther\u00ad apy requesting hypnosis to eliminate his smok\u00ad ing habit was exposed to my usual induction method. A technique that I customarily em \u00ad ploy is to ask the patient to lift his left index finger w hen he experiences certain things that I suggest to him, for example, a fantasying of certain scenes.

H e also resisted sugges\u00ad tions that his left arm would become so stiff and heavy that he could not move it. O n the contrary, he spontaneously waved his arm in the air. O n term ination of the induction, I h u \u00ad morously pointed out these facts and specu\u00ad lated that his negating of my suggestions was probably an expression of oppositional tendencies.

H ad I not utilized hypnosis but just an or\u00ad d in ary interview ing techn iq ue or behavior therapy, the patient would undoubtedly have revealed his oppositional tendencies were I to look fo r them \u2014 if not in his behavior, then in dreams and other representations. T h e p rin \u00ad ciple that I am trying to illustrate is that the therapeutic tactics employed, while aimed at relieving the im m ediate crisis situation or symptomatic upset, will usually set into motion customary resistances and defensive operations that may then be closely examined and worked through, if possible, as a means of inculcating essential insights. In other words, even though the methods may be nonanalytic, the patient\u2019s reactions to them and to the therapist become an im portant exploratory focus, if no more than to deal with obstructive transference and other barriers to change. Personality modifica\u00ad tions eventually may evolve from this as a se\u00ad rendipitous dividend, one that may continue in a propitious environment for an indefinite time and ultimately become a perm anent change. It would seem prudent, obviously, in view of the great dem and for services from the rela\u00ad tively small cadre of available trained th era\u00ad pists, that, at the start, at least, short-term therapy should practically be geared toward goals of optimal functioning. Hopefully, how \u00ad ever, even a brief exposure to therapy will u n \u00ad cover fundamental personality conflicts, which the therapist, if he deems the patient prepared to scrutinize them, may carefully bring to the patient\u2019s attention with the object of inviting reconstructive change should the patient truly desire to move ahead in his development.

Even learning better modes of problem solving req u ire s some insight into internal forces that govern be\u00ad havior. It is precisely because the most disturbing sources of turmoil so often lie beyond aw are\u00ad ness that efforts in many patients applied ex\u00ad clusively toward environmental manipulation, persuasion, suggestion, reassurance, reeduca\u00ad tion, or reconditioning so often are only partially successful. T his is not to depreciate the effectiveness of supportive and educational measures, for in suitable patients, apart from bringing about necessary relief from suffering, a certain degree of personality change may oc\u00ad cur through their implementation. U nfortu\u00ad nately, lasting characterologic alterations are rare. T h e chances are that if we really hope to succeed in bringing about explicit personality change, assuming that this is our goal, we will have to clarify and m anage inner conflicts that are beyond the periphery of awareness in an effort to promote greater self-understanding. T h e question in short-term therapy is whether this can be done briefly in a specific case and, if so, how best it can be done. T raditionally, the method most often em \u00ad ployed in dealing with unconscious conflict is long-term psychoanalysis. A good deal of misunderstanding, however, still exists about psychoanalysis, some of which stems from its misapplication to areas in which its com\u00ad petence as a therapeutic procedure may be challenged. Such misdirection has tended to shred its authenticity. F reu d \u2019s enduring legacy lies in his penetrating insights into hum an be\u00ad havior. These include the concept of the u n \u00ad conscious, the trenchant nature of behavior, the indelible im print of childhood experience on character structure, the consanguinuity of abnorm al mental symptoms and normal m en\u00ad tal processes, the significance of anxiety, the structure of symbolism, the nature of dreams, and the im p ortance of transference and resistance.

Attempts to find other means than classical analysis to expose underlying sources of prob\u00ad lems continue to this very day.

Rather the individual exercises a certain degree of command over inner conflicts, constantly striving to make them conscious so he can gain mastery over them. T o an extent, he is even capable of exercising decisions about which aspects of his unconscious to reveal, titrating their exposure against his tolerance of anxiety. As he works through his anxiety, he becomes increasingly aw are of segments of himself that have been concealed and hence have evaded detection and control. Countering this, of course, are resistances that may obstruct such attempts at self-healing. T h e virtue of the cognitive approach is the philosophy it espouses to the effect that tech\u00ad niques other than formal analysis can be im\u00ad mensely helpful in resolving resistance to the opening up of crucial areas for exploration and ultimately lead to self-understanding.

H ow self-un derstan din g helps to bring deeper problems to the surface and to en\u00ad courage healthier adaptation is not entirely clear. Roy Schafer (1973) expresses it this way: \u201c It is impressive that, as these changes take place in the p a tie n t\u2019s conception of himself, often by dint of and with the accom\u00ad panim ent of much suffering, he begins to feel better and to function better. His symptoms diminish in scope and persistence; his mood improves; his social and sexual relationships are enhanced. It seems that it can be a gain just to be able to recognize one\u2019s neurotic m isery.\u201d W hatever the involved mechanisms, the individual\u2019s sense of mastery is helped. Since the goal of self-understanding requires the uncovering of at least some unconscious de\u00ad term inants, the m anner of their exposure and the timing are especially im portant in short\u00ad term therapy. Generally, the first few sessions will reveal data from the historical material (and particularly the present behavioral pat\u00ad terns of the patient) that offer clues regarding the operative dynamics. Usually it is unwise to present the patient with such clues, no matter how significant they m ay seem, until he himself expresses awareness of what is going on. Even then any interpretations must be cau\u00ad tiously offered in the form of tentative presentations (Wolberg, 1977, pp. 589-590). T h e relationship of expressed conflictual m a\u00ad terial to the present complaint factor is vitally im portant if such a relationship can be dem on\u00ad strated.

Conclusion All persons, irrespective of the degree of emotional illness have a potential for improve\u00ad ment and grow th, both spontaneously through constructive life experiences and, more expedi\u00ad tiously, when treated with appropriate psycho\u00ad therapy. For radical and enduring am endm ents in the personality structure some cognitive alteration is essential. W ithout such change, improved habit and behavioral patterns are apt to be short-lived. D uring therapy far-reaching improvements may be approached by explor\u00ad ing and working through basic conflicts, espe\u00ad cially those revealed in the transference. W here transference is not apparent in the therapeutic situation, it may often be detected in distortions in the individual\u2019s relationship with other people as well as in the dreams, fantasies, and acting-out tendencies. Irrespec\u00ad tive of the techniques that are being employed, (e.g., nondirective interviewing, active anxiety- provoking confrontation, analytic interpreta\u00ad tion, behavior therapy, G estalt approaches, etc.), the patient will respond to these tech\u00ad niques with a wide range of habitual charac- terologic reactions and resistances. T h ese, utilized as a productive focus on which to con\u00ad centrate during therapy, may help penetrate defenses and initiate new ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. A part from the fact that time in treatm ent is usually too short to perm it the development of too intensive transference reactions that reach a point of a transference RATIONALE FOR DYNAMIC SHORT-TERM THERAPY 29 neurosis, it is actually not essential for the p a\u00ad tient to evolve and work through a transference neurosis to achieve extensive reconstructive change. Indeed, the effect of too great an inten\u00ad sification of transference may be to increase resistance to therapy and to prolong treatm ent. W here a relationship is found between the p a \u00ad tient\u2019s presenting symptoms and complaints, prevailing character patterns, and their origins in early life experiences, the process of recon\u00ad structive change is expedited. Such change may continue the rem ainder of the individual\u2019s life, particularly where the p atient\u2019s environment supports the change and he continues self- observation and experimenting with productive new patterns. CHAPTER 3 Criteria of Selection W hile the best patients are undoubtedly those who are adequately motivated for ther\u00ad apy, intellectually capable of grasping im \u00ad mediate interpretations, proficient in working on an im portant focus in therapy, not too de\u00ad pendent, have had at least one good relation\u00ad ship in the past, and are immediately able to interact well with the therapist, they generally constitute only a small percentage of the popu\u00ad lation who apply to a clinic or private practi\u00ad tioner for treatm ent.

Patient Classification In practice one may distinguish at"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_44", "text": "least five classes of patients who seek help. W e have categorized them as Class 1 through 5. In general, Classes 1 to 3 require only short-term therapy. Classes 4 and 5 will need m anage\u00ad ment for a longer period after an initial short\u00ad term regimen of therapy. Class 1 Patients Until the onset of the current difficulty Class 1 patients have made a good or tolerable ad\u00ad justm ent. T h e goal in therapy is to return them to their habitual level of functioning. Among such patients are those whose stability has been tem porarily shattered by a cata\u00ad strophic life event or crisis (death of a loved one, divorce, severe accident, serious physical illness, financial disaster, or other calamity). Some individuals may have been burdened with extensive conflicts as far back as child\u00ad hood but up to the present illness have been able to marshall sufficient defenses to make a reasonable adaptation. T h e imposition of the crisis has destroyed their capacities for coping and has produced a tem porary regression and eruption of neurotic mechanisms. T h e object in therapy for these patients is essentially suppor\u00ad tive in the form of crisis intervention with the goal of reestablishing the previous equilibrium. Reconstructive effects while not expected are a welcome dividend. G enerally, no more than six sessions are necessary. An example of a Class 1 patient is a satisfac\u00ad torily adjusted w om an of 50 years of age who drove a friend\u2019s automobile with an expired license and in the process had a severe acci\u00ad dent, killing the driver of the car with which she collided and severely in ju rin g tw o passengers in her ow n car, w hich w as damaged beyond repair. She herself sustained a concussion and an injured arm and was moved by am bulance to a hospital, w here she remained for a week. C harged with driving violations, sued by the ow ner of the car she borrowed and by the two injured passengers, she developed a dazed, depressed reaction and 30 CRITERIA OF SELECTION 31 then periods of severe dizziness. T h erapy here consisted of a good deal of support, reas\u00ad surance, and help in finding a good lawyer, who counseled her successfully through her entangled legal complications.

In such cases it may be possible to link past incidents, feelings, and conflicts with the present upsetting cir\u00ad cum stances en abling the patien t to clarify anxieties and hopefully to influence deeper strata of personality. In the case above, for ex\u00ad ample, the patient recalled an incident in her childhood when while wheeling her young brother in a carriage, she accidentally upset it, causing a gash in her sibling that required su\u00ad turing. Shamed, scolded, and spanked, the frightened child harb o red the event th at powered fear and guilt within herself. T h e intensity"}

Class 2 Patients T h e chief problem for Class 2 patients is not a critical situation that has obtruded itself into their lives, but rather maladaptive patterns of behavior a n d /o r disturbing symptoms. T h e ob\u00ad ject here is symptom cure or relief, modifica\u00ad tion of destructive habits, and evolvement of more adaptive behavioral configurations. M u l\u00ad tiform techniques are employed for 8 to 20 sessions following eclectic supportive-educa\u00ad tional models under the rubric of m any terms, such as short-term behavioral therapy, short\u00ad term reeducative therapy, and so forth. A phobia to air travel exemplifies the com\u00ad plaints of a class 2 patient. T his was a great handicap for Miss J since job advancement necessitated visits to remote areas. T h e origin of the patient\u2019s anxiety lay in the last flight that she had taken 8 years previously. A disturbance in one of the engines reported to the passengers by the pilot necessitated a return to the point of origin. Since that time M iss J had not dared enter a plane. T herapy consisted of behavioral systematic desensitiza\u00ad tion, which in eight sessions resulted in a cure of the symptom. In utilizing the various eclectic techniques the therapist alerts himself to past patterns th at act as a p a ra d ig m for the present symptom complex, as well as to manifestations of resistance and transference. In a certain num ber of cases the patient may be helped to overcom e resistances th ro u g h resolution of provocative inner conflicts and in this way achieve results beyond the profits of symptom relief. Class 3 Patients Those in w hom both symptoms and be\u00ad havioral difficulties are connected with deep- seated intrapsychic problems that take the form of personality disturbances and inappro\u00ad priate coping mechanisms make up the Class 3 classification. Such patients have functioned at least marginally up to the time of their break\u00ad down, which was perhaps initiated by an im\u00ad mediate precipitating factor. M ost of these pa\u00ad tients seek help to alleviate their distress or to solve a crisis. Some come specifically to achieve greater personality development.

M oreover, he firmly announced his unwilling\u00ad ness to go to college, insisting on finding a job after graduation so that he could buy an a u \u00ad tomobile and pursue his two hobbies: baseball and girls. D urin g the interview with the boy it was obvious that he had motivation neither for further college education nor for any kind of therapeutic help. It was apparent too that his stubborn refusal to study and to go on to higher learning was a way of fighting off the domination of his mother and stepfather. Ac\u00ad cordingly, the mother was advised to stop nag\u00ad ging the boy to continue his schooling. Instead she was urged to permit him to experiment with finding a job so that he could learn the value of a dollar and to discover for himself the kinds of positions he could get with so little education. T h e next day the mother telephoned and re\u00ad ported that she had followed the doctor\u2019s instructions. However, she asked for an a p \u00ad pointment for herself since she was overly tense and suffered from bad backaches that her orthopedist claimed were due to \u201c nerves.\u201d W hat she w anted was to learn self-hypnosis, which her doctor claimed would help her relax. Abiding by her request, she was taught self-hypnosis\u2014 not only for relaxation p u r\u00ad poses, but also to determine the sources of her tension. T h rou gh interviewing aided by in\u00ad duced imagery during hypnosis, she was able to recognize how angry she was at me for not satisfying her desire to force her son to go to college. Images of attacking her father, who frustrated and dominated her, soon brought out her violent rage. She realized then that her obsequious behavior toward her husband was a cover for her hostility. Acting on this insight, she was soon able to express her anger and to discuss her reactions with her husband and the reasons for her rages. T h is opened up channels of communication with a dram atic resolution of her symptoms and an improvement in her feelings about herself and her attitudes toward people, confirmed by a 5-year follow-up.

T h ey thus will have been able through a practical brief therapeutic approach to have been spared the expense, inconvenience, and in some cases the dangers of long-term therapy. CHAPTER 4 A General Outline of Short-term Therapy T here obviously are differences among th e r\u00ad apists in the way that short-term therapy is implemented\u2014 for example, the focal areas chosen for attention and exploration, the rela\u00ad tive emphasis on current as compared to past issues, the attention paid to transference, the way resistance is handled, the depth of prob\u00ad ing, the dealing with unconscious material that surfaces, the precise m anner of interpretation, the degree of activity, the am ount of advice giv\u00ad ing, the kinds of interventions and adjunctive devices employed, and the prescribed num ber of sessions. Moreover, all therapists have to deal with their own personalities, prejudices, theoretical biases, and skills, all of which will influence the way they work. In spite of such differences, there are certain basic principles that have evolved from the experiences of a wide assortment of therapists working with diverse patient populations that have produced good results.

Establish as Rapidly as Possible a Positive Working Relationship (Therapeutic Alliance) An atm osphere of w arm th, understanding, and acceptance is basic to achieving as positive working relationship with a patient. E m pathy p a rtic u la rly is an indispensible p erson ality quality that helps to solidify a good therapeutic alliance. G enerally, at the initial interview, the pa\u00ad tient is greeted courteously by name, the th era\u00ad pist introducing himself as in this excerpt: T h . H ow do you do, M r. Roberts, I am Dr. W olberg. W o n \u2019t you sit dow n over there (p o in tin g to a chair), and we'll talk things over and I \u2019ll see w hat I can do to help you (patient gets seated). P t. T h a n k you, doctor, (pause) A detached deadpan professional attitude is particularly fatal. It may, by eliciting powerful feelings of rejection, provoke protective defen\u00ad sive maneuvers that neutralize efforts toward establishing a working relationship. It is difficult, of course, to delineate exact rules about how a therapeutic alliance may be established rapidly. Each therapist will utilize himself uniquely toward this end in terms of his own techniques and capacities for rapport. Some th era p ists possess an ex tra o rd in a ry ability even during the first session, as the p a\u00ad tient describes his problem and associated feel\u00ad ings, of putting the patient at ease, of mobiliz\u00ad ing his faith in the effectiveness of methods that will be utilized, and of subduing the p atient\u2019s doubts and concerns. A confident enthusiastic m anner and a conviction of one\u2019s ability to help somehow communicates itself nonverbally to the patient. T herapist enthusiasm is an im\u00ad portant ingredient in treatment. T h e following suggestions may prove help\u00ad ful: 35 36 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY Verbalize w hat the patien t m ay be feeling Putting into words for the patient w hat he must be feeling but is unable to conceptualize is one of the most effective means of establish\u00ad ing contact. \u201c Reading between the lines\u201d of w hat the patient is talking about will yield in\u00ad teresting clues.

For example, should he say he is constantly furious, one might reply, \u201c T h is indicates that you are capable of feeling strongly about things.\u201d If he says he detaches and does not feel anything, the a n \u00ad swer may be, \u201c T h is is a sign you are trying to protect yourself from h u r tin g .\u201d C om m en ts such as these are intended to be protective in order to preserve the relationship w ith the therapist.

Another common form of resistance occurs in the person with a psychosomatic problem who has been referred for psychotherapy and who is not at all convinced that a psychological problem exists.

D ealing with areas of tension usually will help relieve the symptom, and as psychotherapy takes hold, it may make it unnecessary to use the symptom to preserve psychological homeo\u00ad stasis. M otivational lack may obstruct therapy in other situations, as w hen a patient does not come to treatm ent on his own accord but is sent or brought by relatives or concerned parties.

Carefully phrased interpretations will be required. It may not be possible to detect basic conflicts in the first interview, only sec\u00ad ondary or derivative conflicts being apparent. M oreover, the patient may not have given the therapist all the facts due to resistance, guilt, or anxiety. O r facts may be defensively dis\u00ad torted.

Define the Precipitating Events It is essential that we identify clearly the precipitating factors that led to the p atient\u2019s present upset or why the patient came to treat\u00ad ment at this time.

And then this thing happened S h e\u2019s completely changed, and I can't understand it. Sometimes the events are obscured or denied because the patient has an investm ent in sustaining situational irritants even while he seeks to escape from their effects. Involvement in an unsatisfactory relatio n sh ip w ith a disturbed or rejecting person from which the patient cannot extricate himself is an example. It may be necessary to encourage continuing conversation about a suspected precipitant, asking pointed questions in the effort to help the patient see the relationship between his symptoms and w hat he may have considered unrelated noxious events. Should the patient fail to make the connections, the therapist may spell these out, asking pertinent questions that may help the patient grasp the association. Evolve a Working Hypothesis After the first session the therapist should have gathered enough data from the present and past history, from any dream s that are revealed, and from the general attitude and be\u00ad havior of the patient to put together some formulation about w hat is going on. T his is presented to the patient in simple language, employing concepts with which the patient has some fam iliarity.

Some pa\u00ad tients insist that they rarely or never dream or GENERAL OUTLINE OF SHORT-TERM THERAPY 43 if they do, that they do not rem ember their dreams. Th.

W h en you aw aken ask yo ur\u00ad self if you dream t. T h e n w rite the dream down. Also, if you w ake up during the night. Study the Patient's Reaction and Defense Patterns T h e utilization of any technique or stra- tegem will set into m otion reactions and defenses that are grist for the therapeutic mill. T h e patient will display a range of patterns that you can study. T his will permit a d ra \u00ad matic demonstration of the patient\u2019s defenses and resistances in actual operation rather than as theories. T h e patient\u2019s dream s and fantasies will often reveal more than his actions or ver\u00ad balizations, and he should continually be en\u00ad couraged to talk about these. T h e skill of the therapist in working with and interpreting the p a tie n t\u2019s sing ular p a tte rn s will determ ine w h eth er these will be in teg rated or will generate further resistance. Generally, a com\u00ad passionate, tentative type of interpretation is best, sprinkling it if possible with a casual light humorous attitude.

While the Focus at all Times is on the Present, be Sensitive to How Present Patterns Have Roots in the Past E xam ining how the patient was reared and the relationship with parents and siblings is particularly revealing. An attem pt is made to establish p a tte rn s th a t have operated throughout the patient\u2019s life of which the cur\u00ad rent stress situation is an immediate manifesta\u00ad tion. T his data is for the therapist\u2019s own con\u00ad sumption and should not be too exhaustive, since the patient if encouraged to explore the past may go on endlessly, and there is no time for this. At a propitious moment, w hen the pa\u00ad tient appears to have some awareness of con\u00ad nections of his past with his present, a proper interpretation may be made. At that time a re\u00ad lationship may be cited between genetic de\u00ad terminants, the existing personality patterns, and the symptoms and complaints for which therapy was originally sought. Watch for Transference Reactions T h e immediate reaching for help encourages projection onto the therapist of positive feelings and attitudes related to an idealized authority figure. These should not be interpreted or in any way discouraged since they act in the in\u00ad terest of alleviating tension and supporting the placebo element. O n the other hand, a negative transference reaction should be dealt with rapidly and sympathetically since it will inter\u00ad fere with the therapeutic alliance. Th.

Examine Possible Countertransference Feelings If you notice persistent irritability, boredom, anger, extraordinary interest in or attraction to any patient, ask yourself w hether such feelings and attitudes do not call for self-examination. T h eir continuance will almost certainly lead to interference with a good working relationship. For example, a therapist is treating an unsta\u00ad ble m iddle-aged fem ale patien t w hom he regards as a plum pish, sloppy biddy who sticks her nose into other people\u2019s affairs. H e tries to m aintain an im partial therapeutic stance, but periodically he finds himself scolding her and feeling annoyed and enraged. H e is always relieved as the session hour comes to an end. H e recognizes that his reactions are coun- tertherapeutic, and he asks himself if they are really justified. T h e image of his own mother then comes to his mind, and he realizes that he had m any of the same feelings of exasperation, displeasure, and disgust with his own parent. Recognizing that he may be transferring in part some of these attitudes to his patient whose physical appearance and m anner re\u00ad mind him of his mother, he is better able to m aintain objectivity. Should self analysis, how \u00ad ever, fail to halt his animosity, he may decide to send the patient to another therapist. Constantly Look for Resistances That Threaten to Block Progress O bstructions to successful therapeutic ses\u00ad sions are nurtured by misconceptions about therapy, lack of motivation, needs to m aintain certain benefits that accrue from one\u2019s illness, and a host of other sources, conscious and unconscious. W here resistances are too stub\u00ad born to budge readily or where they operate with little awareness that they exist, the few sessions assigned to short-term therapy may not suffice to resolve them. O ne way of dealing with resistances once they are recognized is to bring them out openly in a noncondemning m anner. T his can be done by stating that the patient may if he desires hold on to them as defenses, but if this is so, he must suffer the consequences. A frank discussion of why the resistances have value for the patient and their effects on his treatm ent is in order. Another technique is to anticipate resistances from the patient\u2019s past"}

Practice schedules may be agreed on tow ard opposing the situations or tendencies that require control. T h e patient may be enjoined to keep a log regarding in\u00ad cidents that exaggerate his difficulties and w hat the patient has done to avoid or resolve such incidents.

Such responses will necessitate active interpretation of the patient\u2019s past dependency and fears of autonomy. Evidences of past reac\u00ad tions to separation may help the patient ac\u00ad quire an understanding of the underpinnings of present reactions. T h e therapist should ex\u00ad pect a recrudescence of the patien t\u2019s symptoms as a defense against being on his own and as an appeal for continuing treatment.

M an y patients will resent termination of therapy after the designated num ber of sessions have ended. At the middle point of therapy, therefore, the therapist may bring up this possibility. T h e therapist should search for in\u00ad cidents in the past where separations have created untow ard reactions in the patient. In\u00ad dividuals w ho w ere sep arated from their parents at an early age, who had school phobias produced by inability to break ties with the mother, and who are excessively de\u00ad pendent are particularly vulnerable and apt to respond to termination with anxiety, fear, anger, and depression.

GENERAL OUTLINE OF SHORT-TERM THERAPY 47 Stress the Need for Continuing Work on Oneself T h e matter of continuing work on oneself after termination is very much underestimated. Patients will usually return to an environment that continues to sponsor m aladaptive reac\u00ad tions. T h e patient will need some constant rem inder that old neurotic patterns latently await revival and that he must alert himself to signals of their awakening. In my practice I have found that making a relaxing tape (a technique detailed in C hapter 15) sprinkled with positive suggestions of an ego-building nature serves the interest of continued growth. In the event the patient has done well with homework during the active therapy period, the same processes may continue. Institution of a proper philosophical outlook may also be in order prior to discharge. Such attitudes may be encouraged as the need to isolate the past from the present, the realization that a certain am ount of tension and anxiety are norm al, the need to adjust to handicaps and realistic irre\u00ad mediable conditions, the urgency to work at correcting remediable elements in one\u2019s envi\u00ad ronment, the recognition of the forces that trig\u00ad ger off one\u2019s problems and the importance of rectifying these, and the wisdom of stopping regretting the past and of avoiding anticipating disaster in the future. It must be recognized that while the immediate accomplishments of short-term therapy may be modest, the con\u00ad tinued application of the methods the patient has learned during his therapy will help bring about more substantial changes. Arrange for Further Treatment if Necessary T he question may be asked regarding what to do with the patient who at termination shows little or no improvement.

CHAPTER 5 The Initial Interview A. Common"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_70", "text": "Questions T h e initial interview is perhaps the most vital of all sessions since in its conduct rests the fate of the therapeutic alliance and, even more importantly, the eventuality of whether or not the patient will return for further treatm ent. How much time should ideally be spent on his\u00ad tory taking? Should the interview be largely diagnostic or therapeutic? W h at degree of con\u00ad frontation can safely be employed? These and m any other questions challenge the in te r\u00ad viewer. In the present chapter some of the points mentioned in the last chapter will be ex\u00ad pounded by presenting relevant questions (and answers) brought up in teaching and super\u00ad visory sessions with therapists of different theoretical persuasions. W o u ld y ou c o n s id e r th e first session th e rap eu tic o r diagnostic? W hile the initial interview is conducted for the purpose of assessing the presenting prob\u00ad lem and planning treatm ent strategy, it should be managed so that it registers a constructive impact on the patient. It must be stressed that a sizable num ber of patients, especially those that come to outpatient clinics, do not return for a second interview. Follow-up studies show that the initial interview can have a definite therapeutic effect and may even start the p a \u00ad tient on the road to recovery. T h e therapist, therefore, should assume that the first inter\u00ad view will be the only opportunity to work with the patient and thus that enough work must be done so that the patient can leave the session with something positive to grapple onto. T h e initial interview should be conducted in such a way as to give the patient a better idea about his underlying problem and an assay of what he can do to help himself. N aturally, most pa\u00ad tients will return for more sessions unless the therapist has failed to incite their confidence or has com m itted serious erro rs in ap p ro ac h (detachment, belittling attitudes, frightening the patient w ith depth interpretations, hos\u00ad tility, etc.). H ow th o ro u g h sh o u ld histo ry taking be in the initial interview ? D uring the initial interview exhaustive, ri\u00ad tualistic taking of a history is unnecessary.

T hird, one may estimate the degree of anxiety that is manifest or that expresses itself in terms of such symptoms as depression and psychosomatic manifestations. A fourth possibility is to examine the nature of defenses against anxiety, for instance, their ability to contain the anxiety and the effect that they have on the total functioning. Fifth, we ponder the extent of adaptational collapse. Here even though the patient seems to be m ak\u00ad ing a good adjustment, we must ask at what expense. T hus, a detached person may show on the surface a fairly good adjustment. C on\u00ad sequently, it is essential to estimate how truly adequate this is in terms of what is happening to the individual as a whole.

T h e patient with a psychosomatic problem is often unconvinced that his physical symptom is or can be emotionally determined. T h e best way of losing such a patient is to insist that his problem is psychological. Since the patient may, at least temporarily, need his symptom, the therapist is wise at the start of therapy to allow the patient to retain the idea of its or- ganicity. H e may inform the patient that any symptom, even an organic symptom, creates tension because of discomfort or pain. T h e ten\u00ad sion delays healing. W h at needs to be done is to reduce tension, and this can stimulate the healing process. Teaching the patient simple relaxing methods and allowing the patient to verbalize freely should soon establish a th era\u00ad peutic alliance, and through this the patient m ay be helped to come to grips with his w or\u00ad ries and conflicts. A final example is provided by the host of p atien ts w ho are shep arded into th erap y against their free will, such as court cases, spouses of complaining mates, persons collect\u00ad ing disability payments, and individuals de\u00ad riving strong secondary gains from their symptoms through avoiding hard work, sup\u00ad porting dependency needs, and getting atten\u00ad tion and sympathy.

T h e counselor retorts: \u201c If you really have a desire to get more energy, it may be possible for you to rectify this.

H arris et al (1964) describe a 3-year project at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric In \u00ad stitute in San Francisco where a method of up to seven sessions was designed around the focus of the factors that enjoined the patient to come to the clinic. T h e questions explored were why the patient was seeking help at this tim e and w hat he or she expected out of the contact with the clinic. T h is approach served not only as a satisfactory intake method, but also produced a return to adequate functioning in a significant num ber of patients. For the rem aining patients the brief experience helped delineate the prob\u00ad lem, clarified the extent of motivation, and acted as preparation for continuing help or in\u00ad tensive treatment. Focusing on the help-seeking factors is nothing new. Social-work agencies have for m any years employed it in casework on a short-term basis. Similarly some counseling approaches have operated around a similar ex\u00ad posure of the im mediate complaint factor. Both casework and counseling have often substanti\u00ad ated improvement beyond the mere alteration of the en v iro n m en tal d istu rb a n c e s or sym p- tomic upsets that initiated the consultations.

In short-term therapy we usually deal with secondary derivative con\u00ad flicts because of the lack of time for depth probing and the w orking-through of resistance. However, personality changes can result over a period following therapy if the patient con\u00ad sistently works on himself and his problems. Apparently nuclear conflicts may sometimes be influenced through resolution of their m ani\u00ad festations in secondary conflicts. Hitchcock and M ooney (1969), for example, have written how in mental health consultion dealing with the consultee\u2019s work-ego function alone can have a more than superficial effect. D. Beck (1968) has also w ritten an interesting article accenting the value of working on derivative conflicts. In m any types of short-term therapy opening up a \u201c bag of w orm s\u201d through blunt interpretation of a nuclear conflict may create more problems than it solves.

Even if the therapist is wrong or partially wrong in the initial analysis, he will be able to correct or modify his ideas later on. If a connection with personality factors or in\u00ad ner conflicts is not apparent at the beginning, or if the patient is not ready to countenance the implications of such connections, interpreta\u00ad tions may be confined to the immediate envi\u00ad ronm ental precipitants while waiting for more data before linking these to underlying inner difficulties or more obscure external events.

O ptim ism and enthusiasm inspire faith and trust and tend to neutralize despair and hopelessness.

T h e re is som e co n tro v ersy ab o u t the role of positive expectation on the p art of the patien t in p ro m o tin g change. Does ex p ec\u00ad tation influence sh o rt-term therapy? As is usual in some questions, the answ er is yes and no. Expectation that one will change acts as a placebo enhancing the patient\u2019s faith in the therapist and in the operative tech\u00ad niques. T h e therapeutic situation itself is a suggestive arena that promotes expectations of change. O n the other hand, expectation may be bridled to certain assumptions about the therapist\u2019s power and invincibility that can be unrealistic. W hen the patient learns that the therapist has no magic and that the patient himself must work to achieve change, his ex\u00ad pectations may dwindle to nothing and may even act as a negative placebo.

S hould the th e ra p ist p re p a re the p atien t for te rm in a tio n of tre a tm e n t at the first interview ? P roper preparation of the patient for term i\u00ad nation is an extremely im portant, yet the most grossly neglected, aspect of treatm ent. T h e therapist should be alerted for signs, even in the first interview, of im pending problems with termination since the ending of treatm ent can be extremely difficult and disturbing for some patients. M oreover, the therapist will need to be aw are of his own guilt at discharging some patients, particularly those who have become dependent on him. T h e therapist may consider the te rm in atio n of tre a tm e n t a form of abandonm ent. O n the patient\u2019s part, term ina\u00ad tion may kindle previous upsetting reactions with experiences of separation or loss even as far back as childhood. T h e patient may inter\u00ad pret term ination as a sign of the therapist\u2019s ir\u00ad responsibility or lack of concern and this will activate a devalued self-image. If at the first in\u00ad terview the therapist discusses with the patient that some patients respond to termination of treatm ent with resentment and feelings of loss, this may ease, though not entirely dissipate, the patient\u2019s eventual reaction of anger and disappointment. W here the history reveals an early loss of, separation from, or abandonm ent by a parent, the therapist must be triply mindful of the need to prepare the patient for term ination and to watch for early signs of anger, depression, and grief. T h e patient, as part of treatm ent, should be encouraged to talk about developing separation reactions as well as past separation experiences. Among the emerging separation reactions will be a return of old complaints and the development of new symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic com\u00ad plaints. Some patients respond to termination by denial; where there are signs of this, the therapist must actively interpret the response.

A great deal of information can be gotton from the M M T , although a good interviewer can get sufficient material to work on through ordinary history taking. M ost therapists do not give their patients routine tests like the M M T , intelligence tests, and the like, unless there are special reasons for testing. Is it advisable to m ake an initial diagnosis on every case? Yes, for many reasons. T h e initial diagnosis, however, may have to be changed as more in\u00ad formation is obtained during therapy. Are past d rea m s im p o rta n t to e x p lo re in the initial interview ? Very much so. D ream s often reveal the op\u00ad erative dynamics not obtainable through usual interview techniques. Repetitive dream s and nightmares are especially im portant. Asking for dreams that the patient can rem ember from childhood may also be valuable.

If this is tru e, is not th e ra p y su p erflu o u s? Some skeptics downgrade psychotherapy by- pointing out that there is no advantage in formal treatm ent to simply being placed on a w aiting list after an initial interview. For ex\u00ad ample, in one study (Sloane et al., 1975) 94 patients were seen initially by experienced therapists and then random ly assigned to (1) a waiting list, (2) short-term behavior therapy, and (3) short-term psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy for 13 or 14 sessions. Follow-up after 4 months by assessors showed that target symptoms in all three groups improved, but somewhat more so in the treated groups. W ork and social adjustm ent showed no differences. A ll three groups 1 year and 2 years after the initial interview had improved significantly \u201c regardless of w hether or not further treat\u00ad ment was received during this period.\u201d W e might conclude from this that with the no\u00ad treatm ent group doing almost as well as the treated groups after 4 m onths and fully as well after 1 and 2 years, formal psychotherapy was dispensable. T h e fallacy of this assumption is that we fail to credit the initial interview with the th era \u00ad peutic impact that it can score by itself even where no further professional help is secured. N or is it true that a patient on a waiting list languishes w ithout exploiting other helping resources.

CHAPTER 6 The Initial Interview B. Case Histories Although every initial interview will be con\u00ad ducted somewhat differently depending on the presenting problem, the capacity for verbaliza\u00ad tion, the personality of the patient, the initial resistances, countertransference arousal, and so on, certain basic techniques are manifest. T his chapter consists of three transcribed initial in\u00ad terviews that bring out some salient features commonly encountered in first, a developmen\u00ad tal personality problem, second, an obsessive neurosis, and, third, a schizoid personality disorder, who is not deemed suitable for short\u00ad term therapy. Case 1 T h e patient is a 16-year-old boy whose parents called for an appointm ent, saying that he was failing at school, defying his parents, fighting w ith some of his classm ates and generally being obnoxious. W hat concerned them most, however, was his going steady with a girl. T hey did not approve on the basis that he was too young for a serious relationship. T hey were desperate for some direction as to what to do. T h e boy had resisted going to see a therapist until they cut off his allowance, and then he consented to one appointment. T h e parents accompanied him and sat in the w ait\u00ad ing room. T h e session brings out how to deal with a defiant adolescent so that he may con\u00ad tinue in therapy as well as how to select a dy\u00ad namic focus. At the appointed time the patient entered my office, slouched into a chair, and looked about the room in a noncommittal way. T h"}

CHAPTER 7 Choosing an Immediate Focus M an y patients come to therapy convinced that their problems were brought about by some precipitating factor in their environment. An alcoholic husband, a disastrous investment, a broken love affair, a serious accident, these and many other real or exaggerated calamities may be blamed. W hat people usually want from treatm ent is help in getting rid of painful or disabling symptoms that are often ascribed to such offensive events. T h e symptoms include anxiety, depression, phobias, insomnia, sexual difficulties, obsessions, physical problems for which no organic cause can be found, and a great many other complaints and afflictions. Even though we may be correct in our assum ption th a t the basic troubles reside elsewhere than in environmental or sym pto\u00ad matic complaints, to bypass the patient\u2019s im\u00ad mediate concerns is a serious mistake. L ater when there is firm evidence of the underlying causes, for example, faulty personality oper\u00ad ations or unconscious conflict, a good inter\u00ad viewer should be able to make connections be\u00ad tw een the p recip itatin g events or existing sym ptom s and the less a p p a re n t dynam ic sources of difficulty. T here will then occur a change in focus. T his shift, however desirable it may seem, is not always necessary because we may find that our objectives are reached, and that the patient achieves stabilization, w ith o u t delving into corrosive conflicts or stirring up ghosts of the past. It is only where goals go beyond symptom relief or behavioral improvement that we will, in the hope of initiating some deeper personality alterations, delve into dynamic problem areas. Even where the objective is mere symptom relief or be\u00ad havioral improvement, resistance to simple supportive and reeducative tactics may ne\u00ad cessitate a serious look at underlying p er\u00ad sonality factors that are stirring up obstructive transference and other interferences to change. In practically all patients some immediate stress situation, usually one with which the in\u00ad dividual is unable to cope, sparks the decision to get help. Usually the patient considers himself to be the victim rath er than perpetra\u00ad tor of his identified troubles. T his, in some cases, may be true; in most cases it is false. It is necessary, therefore, in all patients to a p \u00ad praise the degree of personal participation in their difficulties. Since we are actually dealing with situations th a t generate tension and anxiety, it is essential to view env iro n m en tal incidents through the lens of their special meaning for the individual. W h at may for one person con\u00ad stitute an insurm ountable difficulty may for another be a boon to adjustment.

T h e understanding of stress necessitates ac\u00ad knowledging that there is no objective measure of it. O ne cannot say that such and such an en\u00ad vironment is, for the average adult, 70 percent stressful and 30 percent nurtu ran t. No matter 90 CHOOSING AN IMMEDIATE FOCUS 91 how benevolent or stressful the environment, the individual will im part to it a special m ean\u00ad ing as it is filtered through his conceptual net\u00ad work. T his shades his world with a signifi\u00ad cance that is largely subjective. Conceptual dis\u00ad tortions p articu larly tw ist feelings tow ard other hum an beings and especially tow ard the self. A self-image that is hateful or inadequate may plague the individual the rem ainder of his life and causes him to interpret most hap pen \u00ad ings in relation to his feelings that he does not have much value. Most of what happens to him in life will be viewed as confirming his own conviction that he is not much good and that nothing that he does will am ount to anything.

H e would then react with depression, rage, and shattered self\u00ad esteem. Yet no sooner would he accumulate any surplus of funds, then he would again plunge into fanciful schemes that ended in disaster. It was only after we had exposed his inner need to fail that he would recognize how he brought his troubles on himself. For a while it w as w ith the greatest effort th a t he restrained himself from indulging in wildcat gambles. I felt that had he not needed to an \u00ad swer to me, he still would have taken impossi\u00ad ble risks. C haracter distortions engendered by defects in development, such as extreme dependency, detachm ent, aggression, m asochism , perfec\u00ad tionism, or compulsive ambitiousness, are what usually prevent the individual from fulfilling himself and taking advantage of environmental opportunities. T h ey make for the creation of abnorm al goals and values that may seriously interfere w ith ad ju stm en t and th at act as sources of stress irrespective of the environment. It is rare then that environmental stress alone is the sole culprit in any emotional prob\u00ad lem.

U nder these circumstances minor environm en\u00ad tal stress can tax coping capacities and break down defenses so that an eventuating anxiety will promote regressive devices like protective phobias. It is, therefore, essential that any precipitating incident that brings a patient into therapy be regarded as merely one element in an assembly of etiological factors, the most im\u00ad portant variable being the degree of flexibility and integrity of the personality structure. It is this variable that determines a harm onious in\u00ad teraction of forces that pow er intrapsychic mechanisms w hen security and self-esteem are threatened by adversity from the outside and 92 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY by common developmental crises that impose themselves from within.

Focusing on Symptoms Because symptoms are frequently a by\u00ad product of stress, tension, and anxiety, it may be helpful to examine their development and meaning within the matrix of adaptation. As long as a person is capable of coping with his current life situation, as long as he can gratify his most im portant needs and dispose of others that he is unable to satisfy, as long as he can sustain a sense of security and self-esteem, and as long as he is able to mediate troubles that vex him, he will not experience stress beyond the point of adaptive balance. W hen, however, this is not possible, the threat is registered as a state of tension, with altered homeostasis af\u00ad fecting the viscera, the skeletal muscles, and the psychic apparatus. T h e person mobilizes himself to cope with the stress and if he is suc\u00ad cessful, homeostasis is restored. W hen attempts at adaptation keep failing, the continuing pres\u00ad ence of tension in turn sabotages the develop\u00ad ment of more effective coping patterns. Overstimulation resulting from continued stress is bound to register its effect on the bodily integrity (\u201c exhaustion reaction\u201d ). Bom\u00ad bardm ent of the viscera with stimuli will tend after a while organically to disturb the func\u00ad tions of the various organs and systems. T o such ensuing disturbances Selye (1950) has given the name \u201c disease of adaptation.\u201d As in\u00ad sidious as are the physical effects of tension, the development of a castastrophic sense of helplessness produces the more disturbing phe\u00ad nomenon of anxiety. And it is often anxiety that brings the patient to therapy. Anxiety and Its Defenses A vast am ount of hum an psychopathology is covered by the generic term anxiety. It is characterized by a violent biochemical and neurophysiological reaction that disrupts the physical, intellectual, emotional, and behav\u00ad ioral functions of the individual. It is indicative of a collapse of a person\u2019s habitual security structure and his successful means of ad ap ta\u00ad tion. So uncomfortable are its effects that the in\u00ad dividual attem pts to escape from it through various maneuvers. These are usually self-de\u00ad feating because those very m aneuvers are often regressive in n ature\u2014 that is, they revive out\u00ad moded childish ways of dealing with discomfort. T hey only further interefere with assertive and productive coordinations. W here anxiety is uncontrolled, an actual return to infantile helplessness with complete loss of mastery may threaten. Reality testing may totally disintegrate, ending in confusion, depersonalization, an inability to locate the limbs in space, incoordination, and loss of ca\u00ad pacity to differentiate the \u201c m e\u201d from the \u201c not m e.\u201d T his threat to integrity may initiate \u201c parent-invoking\u201d tactics ranging from quiet searching for support to screaming, tantrum s, bewildered cries for help, and fainting.

{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_158", "text": "a matter of fact, some anxiety is an ad ap \u00ad CHOOSING AN IMMEDIATE FOCUS 93 tive necessity; its release acts as a signal to alert the individual and to prepare him for emergency action. Small am ounts of anxiety sponsor somatic and visceral reactions that lead to attack or flight. Anxiety even facilitates information processing in the forebrain. T h e physiological and biochem ical p a tte rn s of anxiety are innate in the organism. Its psy\u00ad chological ingredients are unique to the experi\u00ad ences and conditioning of the individual. These, constituting the security apparatus, are organized to reduce and to remove threats to the integrity and safety of the individual. T h e signal of anxiety, therefore, activates adaptive reserves stimulating somatic and psy\u00ad chological m echanism s to p re p a re for an emergency. T h e individual learns to react to minimal cues of anxiety with a constructive de\u00ad fensive reaction that dispels the anxiety and perhaps eliminates its source. But where the defenses fail to operate, anxiety can reach a pitch where it cannot be dispelled. Somatic reactions of a diffuse, undifferentiated, and destructive nature then flood the body. Psy\u00ad chological responses become disorganized. Regressed, childish kinds of behavior, which solve little toward handling an adult anxiety situation, may then emerge. Because the indi\u00ad vidual cannot cope with intense anxiety, he may w ant someone to take over for him. W h at generally shatters the defenses of the person so th a t he responds w ith global anxiety? T h e provocative agent may be any ex\u00ad ternal danger or internal conflict, recognized or unrecognized, that disorganizes the indi\u00ad vidual\u2019s reality sense, crushes his security and self-esteem beyond mediation, and fills him with a catastrophic sense of helplessness to a point where he cannot stabilize himself. It is the meaning to the individual of an experience or a conflict that is the fundam ental criterion as to whether he will respond with uncon\u00ad trollable anxiety. Let us proceed with examination of the physiological and psychological manifestations of the individual suffering from extrem e anxiety since these may be chosen as a focus in therapy. First, there is a vast undifferentiated, explo\u00ad sive discharge of tension which disorganizes the physiological rhythm of every organ and tissue in the body, including muscular, glan\u00ad d u lar, card iovascular, gastro in testin al, ge\u00ad nitourinary, and special senses. Long con\u00ad tinued excitations may produce psychosomatic disorders and ultimately even irreversible o r\u00ad ganic changes. T h us, w hat starts out as a gastric disorder may turn into a stomach ulcer; bowel irritability may become a colitis; hyper\u00ad tension may result in cardiac illness, and so on. Second, there is a precipitation of cata\u00ad strophic feelings of helplessness, insecurity, and devaluated self-esteem. T h e victim often voices fears of fatal physical illness, like cancer or heart disease or brain tum or, as interpreta\u00ad tions of the peculiar somatic sensations or symptoms"}

T hird , there is a w earing down of re\u00ad pressions to the point w here they become paper thin in certain areas. Consequently, a breakthrough of repudiated thoughts, feelings, and im pulses, o rd in a rily controllable, now may occur at random . These outbursts further underm ine security and produce a fear of being out of control, of not knowing w hat to expect. Fourth, various defenses are mobilized, their variety and adaptiveness depending upon the flexibility and m aturity of the individual. If these strategies fail to control or dissipate the sense of terror, then a further set of maneuvers is initiated. Solutions for anxiety will depend on the source of the anxiety as well as the singular personality configurations of the individual. T h e specific types of defense are chosen by the individual for reasons that are not, at our present state of knowledge, fully known. T he following factors are probable. (1) T h e indi\u00ad vidual\u2019s unique experiences and conditionings focus emphasis on problems and coping mech\u00ad anisms developed during certain periods in his life. For instance, as a child the individual\u2019s dependency needs may not have been satisfac\u00ad torily resolved, causing him to measure his self-esteem chiefly in terms of how well loved he was by his parents (and later their inter\u00ad 94 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY nalized images in his conscience). H e will be insecure when confronted with circumstances where he must take an independent stand. (2) Certain defenses appear in childhood that net the child a special gain. Such defenses, if suc\u00ad cessful, establish a pattern of behavior that may be pursued later on. T h u s where violent and aggressive displays intimidate parents into yielding to the child\u2019s demands, he may tend to have outbursts of anger and to intimidate others as a preferred way of dealing with op\u00ad position. (3) Unresolved childish fears, needs, and strivings, with persistence of archaic con\u00ad cepts of reality, will influence the patterns adopted in the face of stress. Fears of the dark or of being alone may return whenever stress is excessive, where these were manifest in child\u00ad hood. (4) Defensive reactions are often condi\u00ad tioned by parental neurotic attitudes and ill\u00ad nesses, which the individual may take over through the process of imitation. A m other\u2019s terro r of lightning storm s or recourse to headaches w hen difficulties come up may be adopted by her child. T h e neurotic individual thus revives early techniques of adaptation that originally helped solve the difficulties in his childhood. Since these techniques have long outlived their use\u00ad fulness, they create m any more problems than they solve. Nevertheless, the individual is apt to implement them in a reflex m anner, almost as if they were the most natural of devices to employ under the circumstances.

T h e defensive technique of the phobia illustrates the destructive influence that a mechanism of defense may yield. T h e inhibition of function characteristic of phobic states is calculated to isolate the individual from certain sources of danger onto which he has projected his inner anxieties. For instance, a woman fearful of yielding to unrestrained sexual impulses may develop strong anxieties while walking outdoors. She may shield herself from such anxiety attacks through the sym p\u00ad tom of agoraphobia, that is, by avoiding leav\u00ad ing her home, except perhaps in the presence of her mother. T h e phobia ultimately results in her incapacitation, interfering with her liveli\u00ad hood and her capacity to establish norm al rela\u00ad tionships w ith people. She may, as a result, undergo a shattering of self-esteem, and her feelings of inferiority may stimulate a further attem pt to isolate herself from others. H er hostility, which is usually directed at her parent on w hom she is so helplessly dependent, may become extreme, and she may have diffi\u00ad culty in expressing or even acknowledging her hateful feelings because they th re ate n her standing with her mother. T hus, while she has employed a defense to shield her from anxiety, she has suffered from gross difficulties in her functional relationships with life and people. T h e defense against the original anxiety plunged her into difficulties as great or greater than the stress that initially inspired her reac\u00ad tion. Because defenses so often are sources of diffi\u00ad culty for w hich psycho th erapeu tic help is sought and because they frequently are an im \u00ad mediate focus in treatm ent, it may be produc\u00ad tive to elaborate on how and why they evolve. In general, four levels of defense are em \u00ad ployed as outlined in T able 7 -1 : (1) conscious efforts at m aintaining control by m anip ula\u00ad tion of the environment, (2) characterologic defenses aimed at m anipulating interpersonal relations, (3) repressive defenses that m an ip u \u00ad late the intrapsychic forces, and (4) regressive defenses that regulate physiological m echa\u00ad nisms. T h e individual may stabilize at any level, while retaining symptoms and defenses characteristic of previous levels. At different times, as stress is alleviated or exaggerated or as ego strengthening or w eakening occurs, there may be shifts in the lines of defense, either up or down.

Every person alive at various times employs some of these e n v iro n m en t-m an ip u latin g devices. Pathological exploitation of certain first-line defenses, ho w ev er\u2014 nam ely, alcohol and drugs\u2014 can cause addictive disorders such as alcoholism and drug addiction.

O n the other hand, a hit- or-m iss app lication of self-help m easures, w ithout awareness of the nature of one\u2019s diffi\u00ad culties, may lead to nothing, necessitating the use of the next line of defense. Second-level defenses: Characterologic defenses In situations of increasing threat it is typical for a person to exploit in exaggerated form his n orm al characterologic drives. A ggression, w ithdraw al, and abnorm al self-image restora\u00ad tion are examples. Idiosyncratic adaptations to stress are de\u00ad veloped early in life, prim arily in coping with the parental figures who are the first source of a child\u2019s security.

L ater in life, w hen anxiety is experienced, there is an un w it\u00ad ting return to the mode of life that worked most effectively in the past. T h u s these modes of defense may be termed \u201c m a n ip u la tin g o n e \u2019s in te rp e rso n al re la tio n \u00ad ships.\u201d If dependency is characteristic for a person, then in time of stress he may become abjectly dependent. If detachment is the way in which a person handles untow ard experiences, then a serious tragedy will cause him p ath \u00ad ologically to isolate and w ithdraw for long periods. It is the exaggeration of the usual mode that is the key to understanding this second level of defense. It is typical of the exaggerated maneuvers of the second defense line that they get the indi\u00ad vidual into interpersonal difficulties. If a high school principal is accused by his teachers of being too controlling, the principal may be\u00ad come threatened. W hen threatened, he fears that he is losing control over his teachers and reacts perhaps by asking that they subm it to him more complete lesson plans and that they sign out of the building w hen leaving for lunch. It is this very control that the teachers objected to in the first place, and the interper\u00ad sonal conflict becomes exaggerated. E x am p les of pathologically exaggerated character drives include m any kinds of inter\u00ad personal, vocational, and educational difficul\u00ad ties. T h e following are typical. Educational and w ork disorders may be sym ptom atic of such excessive dependency that one is unable to p u rsu e any indep en d en t, assertive line of thought or action. T h e w riting of a term paper or the m aking of a business call may represent the exercise of personal responsibility; an indi\u00ad vidual with a devalued self-image may not be able to pursue such an activity on his own. M arital problems, so ubiquitous in our society, CHOOSING AN IMMEDIATE FOCUS 97 and parental mishandling of their children may represent the exaggeration of any or several character strivings. Delinquency and criminality are syndromes representing the excess of hostile aggression. Sexual disorders often portray the nature of the interpersonal disorder. H ypochondriacal preoccupations may depict the fear of injury; psychopaths demonstrate the extravagant cari\u00ad cature of many interpersonal needs; im mature, obsessive, schizoid persons have all, under the threat of anxiety, pressed their life-styles to ex\u00ad treme lengths. Usually, second-line defenses do not w ork effectively. R a th e r they plunge people into such interpersonal difficulties that conflict and stress are heightened rather than reduced.

R ather than have his needs gratified, he drives others away and is more alone. T h e emotionally poor get poorer if there is a blind repetition at the same pattern. Because of the ultimate ineffectiveness of the second line of defense, the individual usually goes on to the next level. Third-level defenses: Repressive maneuvers T h e third level of defense consists of the m anipulation of one\u2019s intrapsychic structure. It is an attempt to gain peace by pushing troubles out of one\u2019s mind. In repression a barrier is set up to the motor discharge of needs, impulses, memories, ideas, or attitudes, awareness of which will set off anxiety. T o avoid anxiety, selected ideational segments are sealed off along w ith any associational m em ories or links, the activation of which may challenge the repression. In this process there may be (1) a blocking in the perception, processing, storage, and retrieval of experiences; (2) an in\u00ad hibition or distortion in the functions of in\u00ad telligence, such as attention, learning, discrimi\u00ad nation, judgm ent, reasoning, and imagination; (3) a blocking in the operations and ex\u00ad pressions of emotions; and (4) a blocking in behavior. T h e necessity of m aintaining repression can absorb the energy resources of the individual. Constantly threatened are breakdowns in the repressive barriers, a filtering of the sealed-off components into consciousness, and a mobi\u00ad lization of anxiety. T h e individual may con\u00ad sequently be victimized by a ceaseless stress reaction, his physical system being in a p er\u00ad petual uproar. V ulnerable organ systems may become disorganized with outbreaks of organic illness. At the same time a symbolic discharge (idisplacem en t o f affect) m ay occur in a t\u00ad tenuated or distorted forms, which will provide some gratification for the repudiated drives. At phases when repressed needs become particu\u00ad larly urgent, or for some reason or other are activated by physiological factors (such as a previously quiescent sexual drive stirring d u r\u00ad ing adolescence) or experientially (as w hen an insult excites slumbering rage and aggression), a direct expression may occur followed by retributive reactions which will appease guilt feelings and serve to restore repressions. T h e understanding of the repressive line of defense can best be seen in two groupings: those efforts aimed at reinforcing repression and the direct or symbolic release of repressed material. First, reaction form ations (such as chastity or heightened morality as a cover for perverse sexual or antisocial desire) m ay become pathologically exuberant in the urgent need to deny the existence of forbidden impulses. Second, there is an inhibition o f function, disturbed apperception, attention, concentra\u00ad tion, and thinking occurring as one selectively inattends to certain upsetting aspects of one\u2019s inner or outer world. D isturbed consciousness m ay take the form of fainting, stupor,"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_165", "text": "or ex\u00ad cessive needs for sleep. Disturbed mem ory to the point of amnesia may develop. Emotional dulling can be seen in a person who exhibits indifference or apathy as a defense against be\u00ad ing involved in a potentially threatening situa\u00ad tion. Sensory defects, motor paralysis, and 98 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY even visceral inhibitions may be conversion reactions that serve to block out the direct awareness of an anxiety-provoking thought or deed. T h u s one may literally not be able to feel a frightening object, see a threatening event, or experience a sexually arousing stim ulus\u2014 if such awareness would provoke undue anxiety. Another effort at reinforcing repression is the development of a phobia. In phobia form a\u00ad tion there is a displacement from a fearsome inner drive to an external object that sym\u00ad bolically comes to represent this drive. T h u s a fear of snakes in a woman may conceal an ex\u00ad aggerated but repressed interest in the male sexual organ. A fear of heights may be a cover of a m urderous impulse for which one may anticipate retributory punishment. F urther attempts to gain peace through repression are through undoing and isolation. By these maneuvers the individual, almost magically, robs a forbidden impulse of any vi\u00ad tality. W hen he thinks an angry thought, he quickly follows it with a thought that \u201c u n \u00ad does\u201d the first thought. O r he does not \u201c feel\u201d the thought, and so he believes his sexual or hostile impulses have no real significance for him. The release of repressed m aterial through direct or symbolic means is the second form by which repressive maneuvers attempt to m ain\u00ad tain a psychic equilibrium. As we have just noted, the first form of repressive maneuver reinforces the repression itself. T h is second form allows for an intermittent direct or sym\u00ad bolic discharge of the repressed material. O ne such type of release is simply an im pul\u00ad sive breakthrough of some forbidden word or thought or impulse. Occasionally an excited episode of acting out some impulse can be noted in a person who otherwise relies heavily on repression as his typical form of defense. T h e fighting drunk may actually be a sober C asp er M ilq u eto ast w hose repressions are temporarily deadened by alcohol, perm itting a hostile release. O bsession, th a t is the repetitive use of reveries and daydream s, is a second means that serves to drain away the repressed material. A sym bolization of forbidden in ner im pulses through obsessional thinking drains off energy but promotes anxiety in their release. T h e in\u00ad dividual may m urder, rape, or torture special people in his fantasies or may explode the world with atom bombs to his own dismay and anxious discomfort. H e may then neutralize his released impulses by engaging in com pul\u00ad sive rituals, which on the surface make no"}

T h u s \u201c evil\u201d thoughts may inspire repeated hand washing as a cleansing ritual. A third measure for liberating repressed m a\u00ad terial is through dissociative states, such as so m n am b u lism , fugues, and m u ltip le p e r\u00ad sonality. Acted out are the repressed impulses, too threatening to be integrated into one\u2019s con\u00ad scious activities, but not rem embered w hen the usual consciousness is restored. Psychosom atic disorders may be a fourth ev\u00ad idence of the release of tensions that have not made their way into conscious awareness. Sensory, somatic and visceral changes may reflect the inner conflicts of an individual. Tics, spasms and convulsions are often sym\u00ad bolic revelations of inner psychic processes that cannot find direct expression. T h e fifth means are the sexual perversions, such as fetishism, exhibitionism, and the like, that discharge erotic tension w hen these be\u00ad come uncontrollable. T h e use of the self as an object fo r ag\u00ad gression is a sixth method by which unaccepted impulses gain some measure of expression. Angry impulses originally directed at others are repressed and then directed against the self. T h e resultant condition may be neurotic depression, a feeling that one is a miserable creature. T h e continuing self-recriminations that the depressed person indulges served to discharge his hostility\u2014 albeit in the w rong di\u00ad rection. T here may also be dangerous abuses of the self, with accident proneness, mutilation tendencies, and even suicide. Finally, a defense mechanism that allows for releasing repressed material is projection. Pro\u00ad jection is a means of repudiating inner drives CHOOSING AN IMMEDIATE FOCUS 99 that are painful and anxiety provoking by a t\u00ad tributing them to outside agencies and influ\u00ad ences. T h u s inner feelings of hate, too d an \u00ad gerous to accept and manage, are externalized in the conviction of being hated or victimized by an oppressor. Avarice may be concealed by a belief that one is being exploited. H om osex\u00ad ual drives may be credited to persons of the same sex toward whom the individual is sex\u00ad ually attracted. T h e projective m echanism serves the purpose of objectifying a forbidden and repressed danger that will justify certain measures, such as the expression of aggression without guilt. In this way punishm ent and self-blame are avoided. By projecting impulses and desires on to the outside world one may insidiously gain acceptance for his own forbid\u00ad den drives. For example, insisting upon the fact that the world is sexually preoccupied, and finding prurient examples for this point of view, a sexually fearful individual may try to lessen the severity of his own conscience that punishes him for his sexual needs.

In this fourth level of defense the individual shows evidence of psychotic functioning. T h ere may be dereistic thinking, disorders of perception (illu\u00ad sions, hallucinations), disorders of mental con\u00ad tent (ideas of reference, delusions), disorders of apperception and comprehension, disorders in stream of m en tal activity (increased or diminished speech productivity, irrelevance, in\u00ad coherence, scattering, neologisms), and defects in memory, personal identification, orientation, retention, recall, thinking capacity, attention, insight, and judgm ent. T h e re is evidence that special syndromes, such as m anic-depressive psychosis and schizophrenia, have genetic com\u00ad ponents that bring out their peculiar charac\u00ad teristics in the face of stressful experiences. These four levels of defense must not be regarded as arbitrary, static states. Each level never occurs in isolation. Each level is always mixed with manifestations of other defensive levels. Conclusion Once we have determined why at this time the patient has presented himself for therapy and explored with him his ideas about his situation including what he believes is behind his troubles, and what he w ants to achieve from treatm ent, we may then select an im \u00ad mediate focus and organize our treatm ent stra\u00ad tegies. A too early concentration on the p a \u00ad tient\u2019s psychopathology and past conditionings that have created his conflicts and circum \u00ad scribed his growth, however im portant these may be, will support regression and encourage long-term lingering in treatm ent. R ather, we should begin to focus on w hat is of im m ediate concern to the patient, such as incidents in life that have precipitated the symptoms for which he seeks help. In focusing on precipitating fac\u00ad tors one must gauge the patient\u2019s vulnerability to stress as well as the virility of the stress fac\u00ad tor itself. In focusing on symptoms the thera\u00ad pist should view them as an assembly of reac\u00ad tions to anxiety as well as consequences of mechanisms of defense. D uring the explorations it is im portant to concentrate on problem solving, while exam in\u00ad ing, encouraging, and helping the release of whatever positive adaptive forces are present in the patient, focusing on the resistances that 100 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY block their operation. In the course of doing this we may be confronted by the patient with his early formative experiences, but these are handled in the context of explaining obstruc\u00ad tions to effective functioning in the present. Ample opportunities will be found later on to switch the focus to areas related to some central dynamic theme by establishing some connection between it and current problems and concerns should this be deemed desirable. Powerful resistance to treatm ent may make a focus on dynamics"}

CHAPTER 8 Choosing a Dynamic Focus A. Probing into the Past Little time is available in short-term therapy to explore the past. M uch better use can be made of the treatm ent hour by dealing with pertinent elements in the here and now. H o w \u00ad ever, where the therapist can determine im por\u00ad tant past events and contingencies that have molded the personality organization, this will facilitate a better understanding of the p a \u00ad tient\u2019s illness and help select an appropriate dynamic focus. Enough data may be available from taking a good history to make assum p\u00ad tions of how the past has entered into the formation of personality distortions that b u r\u00ad den present-day adaptations. M ore immediate clues may be gained from the transference that serves as a vital link to the kinds of early rela\u00ad tionships that existed in actuality or fantasy that have been instrum ental in laying down the foundations of the patient\u2019s character struc\u00ad ture. Because behavior reflects to a greater or lesser degree conditionings set up in the past, it may be difficult to understand it fully without reference to w hat has gone on before. From a practical point of view in short-term therapy it is not possible to devote much effort in explor\u00ad ing the past beyond providing the patient with some guidelines to pursue on his own after the formal therapy period has ended. T his chapter constitutes a review of develop\u00ad ment from a psychodynamic perspective. It is included in this volume as an introduction to the more clinically im portant chapters that fol\u00ad low. Transference O f vital significance to psychotherapists of all persuasions was F reud \u2019s crucial perception that to a greater or lesser degree patients tend to project onto authority figures thoughts, wishes, and feelings identical to those formerly harbored tow ard im portant past personages (parents, parental substitutes, siblings). R eani\u00ad mated during therapy are transference reac\u00ad tions, wholly inappropriate for the present, but reactions that recapitulate antecedent emo\u00ad tional situations. It is as if the patient seeks to relive the periods of infancy and childhood, recovering gratifications and resolving fears through the instrum entality of the therapist, who is endowed with power and attributes such as an infant harbors tow ard parental agencies. T h ere may be exhibited also toward the therapist in transference a host of aberrant attitudes, such as rebelliousness, hostility, sub\u00ad missiveness, and sexual excitement. Such feel\u00ad ings may also develop outside of the thera\u00ad peutic situation with any kind of an authority or sibling figure.

T h e detec\u00ad tion and m anagem ent of transference may, therefore, be crucial and decisive apart from helping to select a pivotal dynamic focus. Synthesizing Factors of Personality Development In order to understand how and why the past survives in the present and the mischief it invokes, it is necessary briefly to sum marize some of the current findings on personality de\u00ad velopment that come from the biological and social fields. Attempts are constantly being made to bring objectivity to the data on de\u00ad velopment by studying material from a num ber of different sources. These include observations by trained workers of newborn babies at hos\u00ad pitals, institutions, and day-care centers; ex\u00ad periences of teachers with children at nursery schools, kindergartens, and grade schools; re\u00ad ports of parents describing the behavior of their offspring; studies or recordings of plays, art productions, dreams, fantasies, and spon\u00ad taneous verbalizations of presumably normal children; psychological tests of children, espe\u00ad cially projective tests; investigations by social workers, correctional workers, and psychol\u00ad ogists of the socioeconomic environm ent, family relationships, and other areas of poten\u00ad tial conflict among maladjusted, delinquent, and criminal youngsters and adults; scrutiny of case records of children with severe emotional problems who have been hospitalized in m en\u00ad tal institutions; observations of psychothera\u00ad pists treating children in their private prac\u00ad tices or in outpatient clinics; exploration of memories, dreams, and transference phenom \u00ad ena that reflect childhood experiences of adult patients receiving psychoanalysis; field studies of anthropologists reporting on the customs, folkways, creative artistic expressions, modes of child rearin g, and fam ily stru ctu re of various cultural groups; demographic surveys by various social scientists of the incidence and prevalence of emotional problems in different parts of the world; analysis of reactions of in\u00ad dividuals to psychotropic drugs; accounts by ethologists of anim al behavior in a natural set\u00ad ting; and research findings of animal experi- m entors who have subjected higher mam m als to artifacts in upbringing or to motivational conflicts. Objective appraisal of this vast data requires a more a less precise application of the scien\u00ad tific method. U nfortunately, investigators in the field of personality research are han di\u00ad capped by formidable methodological problems in attem pting to subject their observations to clinical research. Moreover, current theories of hum an behavior are so complex, their inherent terms so operationally indefinable, their deri\u00ad vations so diffuse, their implications so global that we are unable to expose them readily to scientific experiment.

D evelopm ental studies, as has been indicated above, show that personality strength or weakness is more or less determined by the experiences during childhood. T h e child will tend to identify with the characteristics of those w hom he admires, and to evolve an idealized image of himself (ego ideal) fashioned after the person or per\u00ad sons he venerates. If, in the first few years of life, the individual has developed a feeling of security, a sense of reality, a good measure of 104 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY assertiveness, positive self-esteem, and c a \u00ad pacities for self-control, he will probably be able to en du re considerable env iron m en tal hardships thereafter and still evolve into a healthy adult. O n the other hand, early unfa\u00ad vorable development handicaps the child in managing even the usual vicissitudes that are common to growing up. T his does not mean that all children with a good personal sub\u00ad structure will inevitably emerge as healthy adults since an overly harsh environment can inhibit developm ent at any phase in the growth process. N or does it imply that a child with an inadequate personality structure may not in the face of favorable circumstances over\u00ad come severe early impediments in grow th and m ature to satisfactory adulthood. W ere we to subscribe to the pessimistic philosophy that all early psychic dam ag e is irre p a ra b ly p e r\u00ad manent, we would blind ourselves to the ef\u00ad ficacy of psychotherapy that is predicated on the assumption that it is possible through the emotionally corrective experience provided by treatm ent to overcome m any childhood p er\u00ad sonality distortions. Personality traits in adult life, however, are never an exact reduplication of childhood striv\u00ad ings. Early conditionings are tempered by ex\u00ad periences in later life that tend to modify, neu\u00ad tralize, or reinforce them. Moreover, though behavior is influenced by patterns rooted in the past, responses vary widely in different situa\u00ad tions in accordance with their symbolic signifi\u00ad cance and the prevailing social role played by the person at the time. T h e sundry variations of personality strivings in operation are in\u00ad finite.

U npropitiated early needs constantly ob\u00ad trude them selves on the individual, propelling him tow ard direct or sym bolic actions to satisfy these needs. A m an deprived during infancy of adequate sucking pleasure may constantly be obsessed with a need for mouth stimulation, over-indulging himself with food and alcohol to the point of obesity and alcoholism. A w om an, restricted as a child in physical activity and assertive behavior on the basis that she was a girl, may continue to envy men and their possession of the emblem of masculinity, the penis. Accordingly, she will attem pt to p a t\u00ad tern her life along lines commonly pursued by males, masculinity being equated in her mind with freedom and assertiveness. W ith dogged persistence she will deny feminine interests, and she may even clothe herself in masculine\u00ad like attire, cropping her hair after the style of men. Defenses evolved in childhood m ay carry over into adu lt life w ith an astonishing persistence. A boy, overprotected and sexually overstim ulated by a d oting m oth er, may vigorously detach himself from her. W hen he grows up, he may continue to avoid contact with women; any attempts at sexual play may result in incestuous guilt to a point w here he is unable to function. A child rigorously and pre\u00ad maturely toilet trained may regard his bowel activities as disagreeable and filthy. O ver\u00ad cleanliness, overorderliness, o verm eticulous\u00ad ness ensue and burden his adult adjustment.

L ater the manifestation of hostility seems to be a condition prerequisite for any kind of sexual expression, sexual sadism being the ultimate outcome.

Henceforth indulgence of the trait of perfectionism m ay be\u00ad come an essential factor in his experiencing any degree of positive self-esteem.

Another example of a nuclear conflict is evi\u00ad denced in a teenager who establishes pseudoin\u00ad dependence through invariably doing the op\u00ad posite of what his parents ask. A request to wear a green shirt immediately establishes in him an intensely felt desire to w ear a red shirt.

Some Common Dynamic Themes By their effect on the personality structure the developmental vicissitudes set forth in the last chapter are responsible for a host of symptoms, coping mechanisms, and defenses that provide m any dynamic themes on which we may focus. Because it is difficult for some patients to conceptualize these themes, it may be expedient to simplify personality operations and distortions by picturing them as products of the operation of five powerful motors: ex\u00ad cessive dependency, resentment, reduced inde\u00ad pendence, devalued self-image, and detach\u00ad ment. Dependency Often at the core of problems is the first m o\u00ad tor, excessive dependency needs, that had not been adeq uately resolved in childhood. A healthy balance between dependency and inde\u00ad pendence is essential for emotional well-being. W here it does not exist, problems ensue. M ost likely the average person\u2019s childhood yearnings for nurture and affection were not optimally met, leaving a residue of unmet needs that tend to express them selves intensely w hen the pressures of life mount. O r dependency was pathologically encouraged by a m other who utilized the child as a vehicle for her own unfulfilled demands, ham pering the child\u2019s growth and strivings for independence. U nre\u00ad solved dependency is a ubiquitous fountain- head of troubles. It stem s from w hat is perhaps the most common conflict burdening human kin d \u2014 in adequ ate sep a ra tio n -in d ivid u a tio n . And people are apt to blame their troubles on the world: the revolt of youth, governmental corruption, inflation, comm unism, capitalism, or the atom bomb. M ost people, however, somehow muddle through, w orking out their troubles in one way or another. It is only w here separation-individuation is too incom\u00ad plete and dependency needs too intense that so\u00ad lutions will not be found. People with powerful dependency needs will often cast about for individuals who dem on\u00ad strate stronger qualities than they themselves possess.

Consequently, he will w ant to escape from the relationship. Also, as he senses his dependency, he will feel that he is being passive like a child. And this is frightening be\u00ad cause he knows that he is not being manly; he may actually have homosexual doubts and fears since m asculinity is associated w ith activity and independence. W e will call his first maneuver his de\u00ad pendency motor, which begins to operate espe\u00ad cially at times when he is under pressure. As he searches for the element missing in his psy\u00ad chological diet, namely a parental figure, he will most assuredly be disillusioned. W om en are no less victimized by dependency than are men. And their reactions are quite similar in that they are apt to regard both males and fe\u00ad males on whom they get dependent as poten\u00ad tial nurturing mother figures. They are also no less subject to the consequences of the other motors that we shall describe. Resentment A second motor that inevitably accompanies the first is the resentm ent motor. Resentment invariably fires off because either one must find a perfect parent who will take care of him or he feels trapped when someone does take care of him and he senses his own passivity and helplessness. Resentment breeds guilt because people just are not supposed to be hateful. Even guilt does not always keep the hostility hidden. Sometimes when our man has had too much to drink or when he is very frustrated about something, his hate feelings leak or pour out.

These may range from fouling up a business deal to inability to accept success, to dangerous ac\u00ad cident proneness, to physical illness, to foolish, outrageous, or em barrassing behavior. Low Independence N ow our m an has two motors going most of the time when under pressure: the dependency motor and the resentment motor, w ith ac\u00ad companying kickbacks of guilt and masochism. T h e picture is not complete, however, without a third motor, low independence, which is an invariable counterpart of high dependence. Low independence is a feeling that one cannot gain, by his own reason or strength, the desira\u00ad ble prizes of our culture\u2014 w hether they be love and justice or wine, women, and song. A spin\u00ad off of low independence is a feeling of infe\u00ad riority, a lack of proficiency on achieving de\u00ad sirable goals. Part and parcel of inferiority feelings is the uncertainty about being manly and masculine. Self-doubts about one\u2019s sexual integrity are torturous; the usual sequel is to try to compensate by being the quintessence of everything masculine: overly aggressive, overly competitive, and overly dominating. Proving himself with women may lead to satyriasis and D on Juanism . O u r m an may have fantasies and images in his mind of strong men (often symbolized by their possessing large penises) and may be particularly attracted to them be\u00ad cause of their strength. But his awareness of how much he thinks about men may cause him to w onder if he is homosexual and to fear the very things that he admires. H e may actually on occasion be sexually attracted to idealized male figures, and he may fantasize incorporat\u00ad ing their penises into himself.

W hile he may be able to be giving on his own terms, an unex\u00ad pected appeal from som eone else w ill be regarded as a vulgar imposition. H e actually w ants for himself someone on whom to lean and be dependent. However, giving in to such a desire speeds up all his motors and makes him feel even worse. H e pursues just the reverse course from his original dependency drive; he competes with any strong figure on w hom he might w ant to lean. H e shows the pseudoindependence rem iniscent of the adolescent who disagrees on principle with w hatever his parents say. And he may com\u00ad pensate for his devalued self-image by exploit\u00ad ing all the cultural symbols of being a worthy person, such as being perfectionistic, com pul\u00ad sively ambitious, and pow er driven. These com pen satory drives m ay preoccupy him mercilessly, and he may organize his life around them. O ne failure means more to him than twenty successes, since it is an affirmation of his lowly status. T hese difficulties are compounded by the way they interact with our m a n \u2019s sexual needs. W h en o n e \u2019s dependency needs are being gratified, there is often a pervasive feeling of well-being that floods one\u2019s whole body. U pon aw akening following surgery, for example, the confident, smiling face of a nurse can suffuse a m an with grateful, loving feelings, at least part of which may be sexual.

In women feelings of defective in\u00ad dependence may inspire a rejection of the feminine role and fantasies of possessing a penis, the symbol in our culture of pow er and independence. Sadism and masochism may also be acted out in sexual activities in both men and women. T h e reverberating of all these machines calls for strenuous efforts on the part of our subject. It all began with the dependency motor, which then activated the resentment motor (together with its components of aggression, guilt and masochism). T his threw into gear the third motor of low independence, which in turn fueled the fourth motor of self-devaluation with its overcompensations and sexualizations.

O u r man finds loneliness to be a worse state than what he was enduring before. H e realizes that people con\u00ad stitute one of life\u2019s richest gratifications. So, he plunges in again.

T h e return to a childish dependent position apparently mobilized fears that in too close as\u00ad sociation with a m other figure he would be 118 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY subjected to multilation and destruction. Sex\u00ad ual feelings toward his wife were equated with forbidden incestuous feelings for which the penalty was bloody mutilation. Fantasies of ac\u00ad cidents and bloodshed could be reflections of Roger\u2019s castration fears. T h e repetition of the oedipal dram a thus could follow a shattering of Roger\u2019s repressive system. Attem pting to rein\u00ad force repression by repressive (th ird -lin e defenses, see p. 76), Roger employed phobia formation striving to remove himself from symbols of mutilation such as knives and other cutting instruments. W h e n asked if he had o th e r sy m p to m s or fantasies, Roger, in an em barrassed way, confided th at in the presence of forceful or strong men, he ex\u00ad perienced a peculiar fear, which he tried to conceal.

T h e fear Roger manifested of strong males, the desire to act in an affectionate way with them, the terror of homosexual assaults by nude men with huge genital organs were, if we follow our previous line of reasoning, the products of his fear of attack by father figures irate at his appropriation of the m aternal ob\u00ad ject. A disintegration of R oger\u2019s sexual life was inevitable because he was relating to his wife not as a husband but as a child. Abandonm ent of a male role with his wife was, therefore, necessary to avoid anxiety. W hile serving as a spurious protective device, his sexual inhibition obviously further underm ined his self-esteem. In attem pting to make a tentative diagnosis of R oger\u2019s condition at this point, I was con\u00ad fronted with the contem porary contradictions that plague our attempts at classification. All emotional difficulties spread themselves over a wide pathological area, involving every aspect of the person\u2019s functioning\u2014 intellectual, em o\u00ad tional, physical, and behavioral. Based as they are on presenting complaints and symptoms, systems of nosology often lose sight of the fact that the entire hum an being is embraced in any emotional upheaval. T h e particular classification into which a patient fits then may depend merely upon the relative emphasis the diagnostic agent (i.e., the therapist) or the p a \u00ad tient puts upon selected symptoms. T his may be illustrated in the case of Roger. His complaints were those of tension, ir\u00ad ritability, explosiveness, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic symptoms, phobias, and ob\u00ad sessive thoughts. In addition, he exhibited a character disturbance in such manifestations as excessive subm issiveness and dependency. W ere Roger chiefly concerned with his physi\u00ad cal ailm ents\u2014 his headaches, dyspepsia, list\u00ad lessness, fatigue, failing health, or impotence\u2014 we would be inclined to regard him as a per\u00ad son suffering from physical disorders of psy\u00ad chological origin, that is, a type of somatoform disorder. Should his anx iety attacks have caused him greatest concern and were he to have focused his attention on his anxiety, we might classify him as \u201c anxiety disorder.\u201d In the event his depression was of prime interest, a diagnosis of \u201c psych on eu rotic or reactive depression\u201d might be entertained. If emphasis had been put on his obsessive concern with bloody am putations, death, and pointed objects, he might be called an \u201c obsessive disorder.\u201d His fear of heights, subways, buses, and crowds and of solitude and the dark are those often found in \u201c phobic d is o rd e rs .\u201d F inally, had his su b \u00ad m issiveness, passivity, and o ther c h a racter defects been considered his most significant problem, he might be labeled as a \u201c personality d is o rd e r.\u201d T h e m a tte r of diagnosis, then, would be essentially a m atter of what seemed immediately im portant.

T h is diagnostic p o t\u00ad pourri is not surprising w hen we consider that every individual whose homeostasis has broken down exploits dynamism characteristics of all levels of defense in addition to displaying m anifestations, psychological and p hy sio \u00ad logical, of homeostatic imbalance and adapta- tional collapse. W hen Roger was asked w hat he believed had precipitated his anxiety originally, he was unsure, but he hazarded that it might have been related to a change in his position at work. N ot long after his tenth wedding anniversary, at age 33, Roger was prom oted to senior m em ber of the firm. His elation at this was short-lived as he became conscious of a sudden dep ressed feeling, w h ich progressively deepened. Inertia, boredom, and w ith draw al from his ordinary sources of pleasure followed. Even his work, to which he had felt himself devoted, became a chore. Always eager to cooperate, he experienced, during work hours, a vague dread of som ething about to happen which he could not define. He could not understand why he would react to a pro\u00ad motion that he wanted by getting upset. Should a therapist not be interested in pursuing the patient\u2019s symptoms further to de\u00ad termine their origin in early past experience or in unconscious conflict, in other words, avoid\u00ad ing a dynamic approach, an abbreviated a p \u00ad proach aimed at symptom reduction might now be selected w ithout further probing into history. First, an effort may be made to treat his symptoms through medicaments, like sedatives or tranquilizers for anxiety and energizers for depression. Roger may be enjoined to slow down in his activities and to detach himself as much as possible. He might be requested to take a vacation, engage in hobbies and recrea\u00ad tions in order to divert his mind off his difficul\u00ad ties. Another way of handling the problem might be to assume the source of the difficulty to be Roger\u2019s work situation and to get him to change his job to one that did not impose too great responsibility on him. H e would be en\u00ad couraged to try to detach himself more from his wife and slowly to begin functioning again on the basis of the customary distances that he erected between himself and others. Active guidance and reassurance may make it possible for Roger to return to his own bedroom and to assume the reserve with his wife that would enable him to function without anxiety. O n another level, the therapist might utilize behavior modification methods to desensitize the patient to his anxieties as well as to in\u00ad stitute assertive training to prom ote greater self-sufficiency and independence.

Roger was the younger of two brothers. H e was reared by a dom ineering m other w ho was resentful of her role as housewife, which had halted a success\u00ad ful career as a fashion designer.

T h e dynamics in R oger\u2019s case became a p \u00ad parent during therapy. Basic to his problem was a disturbed relationship with his parents, particularly his mother. T h e yielding of her 120 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY unm arried professional status to assume the role of housewife apparently had created in the mother resentment toward her husband and rejection of her children. T his inspired a \u201c reaction form ation\u201d in the form of overpro\u00ad tection, particularly toward her younger child, Roger. Frustrated and unfulfilled, she used Roger as a target for her own needs and am bi\u00ad tions with the following effects: (a) in Roger, encouragement of overdependence and pas\u00ad sivity, strangling of assertiveness and inde\u00ad pendence, and stimulation of excessive sexual feelings toward the mother and (b) in George, hostility displayed directly toward Roger as aggression, and (c) in her husband, detach\u00ad ment. Overprotected by his m aternal parent, neglected by his father, and abused by his brother, Roger took refuge in the relationship offered him by his mother.

H e revolted, however, against too great dependency on her, fearing that excessive closeness would rob him of assertiveness and that his aroused sexual feel\u00ad ings would bring on him disapproval from his mother as well as punishm ent from his father and brother. Repudiating competitiveness with the other male members of the family, he at\u00ad tempted to win their approval by a submissive, ingratiating attitude. D urin g adolescence Roger emerged as a quiet, detached lad, never perm itting himself to be d raw n into very intim ate relationships. H e was an ex\u00ad cellent and conscientious student, and he was well liked for his fairness and am iability. At college he w as retiring, but he had a n um b er of friends who sought his com panionship because he was so easy to get along with. His rom antic attachm ents were superficial, and the young w om en he squired to parties adm itted that he w as attractive but com \u00ad plained that it w as difficult to get to know him. Adopting detachment as a defense against a dependent involvement, and compliance as a means of avoiding physical hurt, Roger evolved a character structure that enabled him to func\u00ad tion at home and at school, although at the ex\u00ad pense of completely gratifying relationships with people. U pon leaving college, he entered a business firm, arrang em en ts for this having been m ade by his father. H e resisted for two years the exhortations of his m other to m arry the d aughter of one of her best friends; but finally he succumbed, and he seemed satisfied and h ap p y in his choice.

His failing health, fatigue, pallor, listlessness, dyspeptic attacks, and migrainous headaches were evidences of adaptive im bal\u00ad ance. W hat inspired this imbalance was an in\u00ad vasion of his capacity to detach, produced by the demands made on him by his wife and as\u00ad sociates. In addition, his submissive and com\u00ad pliant behavior, while protecting him from imagined hurt, engendered in him overpower\u00ad ing hostility, which probably drained itself off through his automatic nervous system produc\u00ad ing physical symptoms. As might be expected, R oger\u2019s affability and needs to please won for him the praise of his superi\u00ad ors at work, and he was advanced and finally of\u00ad fered a senior position. H ad Roger at this point refused to accept senior membership in the firm, he might have escaped the catastrophe that finally struck him. H is legitimate desires for advancement, how \u00ad ever, enjoined him to accept. His conflict be\u00ad came more and more accentuated until finally he no longer was able to marshal further defenses. Collapse in adaptation with helpless\u00ad ness and expectations of injury announced them selves in an anxiety attack d u rin g luncheon with his friend. As long as he had been able to satisfy to a reasonable degree his needs for security, asser\u00ad tion, satisfaction in work and play, and crea\u00ad tive self-fulfillment, Roger was able to make a tolerable adjustment even with his psychoso\u00ad matic symptoms. T h e precipating factor that had brought about the underm ining of R oger\u2019s capacities for adaptation was his promotion to senior membership in the firm. W hile Roger had ardently desired this p rom otio n, for reasons of both status and economics, actually being put in a position of parity with his friend violated his defense of passivity, compliance, and subordination and threatened him with the very h urt he had anticipated as a child in relationship to his father and brother.

{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_202", "text": "of his ego. Conclusion C o m m on psychodynam ics are shared by people in o u r culture. T h e y include the ravages of high dependency, resentment and hostility, low independence, a devaluated self- image, and detachment. It is the degree of intensity of these drives that determine their pathogenicity. Offshoots from resentment in\u00ad clude aggression, perhaps to the point of sadism, and also guilt resulting from the hate\u00ad ful feelings, even eventuating in masochism. H igh dependency is associated with passivity and a fem inine identification. F eelings of hostility sponsor guilt, masochism, aggression, and sadism. Low independence prom pts the overcompensatory strivings of compulsive ag\u00ad gressiveness and competitiveness, m aking for a neurotic masculine identification. A devalued self-image also leads to compensatory measures such as perfectionism , .am bitiousness, and pow er drives. And detachment often provokes one to abandon one\u2019s isolation and plunge into compulsive gregariousness. Any and all of these drives may become sexualized, so that o ne\u2019s sexual impulses become linked to feelings of incestuous passivity or competitive dom ina\u00ad tion with consequent fears of retaliation or with masochistic or sadistic impulses. W hen these drives fail to m aintain homeostasis and conflict is unresolved, then anxiety results and various levels of defense mechanisms operate to cope with the anxiety. A great m any dynamic themes eventuate (see Figure 9 -2) and offer themselves as possible foci for exploration. CHAPTER 10 Choosing a Dynamic Focus C. Presenting Interpretations T h e most effective focus is one that deals with a basic repetitive conflict, the manifest form of which is being expressed through the immediate complaint factor. As an example, consider a crisis situation involving a wife, the mother of two small children, who insists on a divorce because of continuing disenchantm ent with her marriage. T h e divorce decision a p \u00ad pears to be the terminal eruption of years of disappointment in her hu sb an d \u2019s failure to live up to her ideal of w hat a m an should be like. After we cut through endless complaints, it be\u00ad came apparent that the standard against which she measures her husband is her father, whom she worships as the epitome of success and m asculinity. T h is idealization actually has little basis in fact, being the rem nant of an u n \u00ad resolved oedipal conflict. Be this as it may, it has thw arted her ability to make a proper ad\u00ad justm ent to her marriage, and now w ith the decision of a divorce the integrity of her family is being threatened. She comes to therapy at the urging of her lawyer who realizes that she is too upset at present to make reasonable deci\u00ad sions. A therapist who minimizes the im portance of dynamic conflicts may attem pt to achieve the goal of crisis resolution by invoking logic or appeals to common sense. H e may suggest ways of patching things up, insisting"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_203", "text": "that for the sake of the children a father, however inadequate, is better than no father. H e may, upon consulting with the husband, point out various compromises the husband can make, and after the wife has verbally disgorged a good deal of her hostility in the therapeutic session, she may be willing to cancel her di\u00ad vorce plans and settle for half a loaf rather th a n none. T h e reconciliation is executed through a suppression of her hostility, which finds an outlet through sexual frigidity and various physical sym ptom s. O n the other hand, should the therapist recognize the core conflict that is motivating her idea of divorce, there is a chance that the patient may be helped to an awareness of her merciless in\u00ad volvement w ith her father and the destructive unreasonableness of her fantasies of w hat an ideal m arriage is like. She may then allow herself to examine the real virtues of her hus\u00ad band and the true advantages of her existing marriage. A dynamic focus should, therefore, be pros\u00ad pected in the course of exploring the immediate complaint factor. Such a focus is often arrived at intuitively (B inder, 1977). T h e m ore empathic, skilled, and experienced the th era\u00ad pist, the more likely he will be to explore the actual operative dynamics. However, no m at\u00ad ter how firmly convinced he is in his im \u00ad mediate assumptions, he realizes that these are being predicated on incom plete data. H e knows that his patient may deliberately w ith\u00ad hold im portant information, or though the pa\u00ad tient may recognize certain conflicts she is still oblivious to their significance or completely unaw are of their existence. W hatever tentative theories come to the therapist\u2019s mind, he will continue to check and to revise them as further information unfolds. Interviews with relatives 125 126 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY and friends are extremely valuable since they may open facets of problems not evident in the conversations with the patient. Moreover, once the patient during the first encounter has di\u00ad vulged data, later interviews will help uncover rationalizations, projections, and distortions that will force the therapist to revise his thesis and concentrate on a different focus from the one that originally seemed so obvious. No matter how astute the therapist has been in exposing a truly momentous focus, the p a \u00ad tient\u2019s reactions will determine whether the ex\u00ad posure turns out to be fruitful or not. For ex\u00ad ample, even though an underlying problem is causing havoc in a p e rs o n \u2019s life and is responsible for the crisis that brings the person to therapy, this does not imply that the patient will elect to do anything about it.

T his happening was so widely publicized in the industry that the patient was unable to secure another job. D uring therapy the patient was confronted with the m eaning of his behavior and particu\u00ad larly his revenge and masochistic motives; he readily recognized and accepted their validity.

CHOOSING A DYNAMIC FOCUS: PRESENTING INTERPRETATIONS 127 Lest we overemphasize the power of insight in bringing about change, we must stress that to a large extent the choice of a focus will depend on the therapist\u2019s seeing the presenting problem of the patient through the lens of his theoretical convictions. A Freudian, Ju ngian, A dlerian, K leinian, H o rn ey ite, Sullivanian, Existentialist, or behavior therapist will focus on different aspects and will organize a treat\u00ad ment plan in accordance with personal ideol\u00ad ogies. W hile the focus, because of this, will vary, there is considerable evidence that how the focus is implemented and the quality of the relationship with the patient are at least as im \u00ad portant factors in the cure, if not more so, than the prescience of the therapist and the insight\u00ad ful bone of dynamic wisdom he gives the pa\u00ad tient to chew on. T h a t im plantations of insight sometimes do alter the balance between the repressed and repressive forces cann ot be disputed. How much the benefits are due to this factor and how much are the product of the placebo effect of insight, however, is dif\u00ad ficult to say. W here a therapist is firmly con\u00ad vinced of the validity of the focus he has chosen and he convinces his patient that neurotic demons within can be controlled through ac\u00ad cepting and acting upon the \u201c in sig h ts\u201d presented, tension and anxiety may be suffi\u00ad ciently lifted to relieve symptoms and to pro\u00ad mote productive adaptation. Even spurious insights if accepted may in this way serve a useful purpose.

In the conduct of brief treatm ent one may not have to deal with the underlying conflicts such as those above as long as the p a tien t is m oving along and m aking progress.

At some point an explanation of where such prom ptings originated and how they are now operating will have to be given the patient. T h is explanation may at first fall on deaf ears, but as the therapist consistently demonstrates their existence from the p atient\u2019s reactions and patterns, the patient may eventually grasp their significance.

For example, the patient may during a session complain of a severe headache and thereafter proceed to beat himself masochis\u00ad 130 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY tically, blaming himself for being weak and ineffectual. T h e therapist should then search to see how this trend affiliates itself with guilt feelings and w hat immediate situation inspired such feelings. T h e therapist may discover that w hat is behind the guilt is anger in the patient at his wife for not living up to his expectations in executing her household duties. Further probing may reveal anger at the therapist for not doing more for the patient. Such tran s\u00ad ference manifestations may enable the thera\u00ad pist to make a connection with the patient\u2019s mother toward whom there has existed since childhood a good deal of anger for her neglect and rejection. T h is will open up a discussion of the patient\u2019s excessive dependency needs and the inescapable hostility, low independence, and devalued self-esteem th at dependency brings about. An association m ay be es\u00ad tablished between the patient\u2019s hostility turned inward and the migraine headaches for which therapy was sought in the first place. T h e therapist should in this way take advantage of every opportunity to show the patient the in\u00ad terrelatio n sh ip betw een his various drives, traits,' and symptoms, keeping in mind that while a certain trend may encompass the p a\u00ad tient\u2019s chief concern at the moment, it never occurs in isolation.

An individual can make a reasonable adjust\u00ad ment for a long time even with a vulnerable character structure.

W e may, nevertheless, attem pt to work with cognitive therapy and select perfectionism as a focus, pointing out the distortions in logic that govern the patient\u2019s thinking process. Not all therapists have the skill and stamina to do this, nor do we yet have sufficient data to testify to the efficacy of this approach in most cases. W h at would seem indicated is to review with the patient the full implications of his perfectionism, its relationship to his defective self-image, the sources of self-devaluation in incomplete separation-individuation, the oper\u00ad ations of masochism, and so forth.

By removing himself from people, the indi\u00ad vidual tries to heal himself. But this does not usually w ork because after a while a person gets terrified by his isolation and inability to feel. People cannot function w ithout people. T h ey may succeed for a short time, but then they realize th ey are d riftin g a w a y from things; they are depriving themselves of life\u2019s prim e satisfactions.

H e m ay, in desperation, push himself into a dependency situation with a parental figure as a w ay out of his dilem m a. And this will start the whole neu \u00ad rotic cycle all over again. You can see that the person keeps getting caught in a web from which there is no escape. As long as he has enough fuel available to feed his various motors and keep them running, he can go on for a period. But if opportunities are not available to him to satisfy his different drives and if he cannot readily switch from one to the other, he m ay become excessively tense and upset. If his tension builds u p too much, or if he ex p eriences g reat tro u b le in his life situation, or in the event self esteem is crushed for any reason, he m ay develop a catastrophic feeling of helplessness and expecta\u00ad tions of being hurt. (The patient here excitedly blurted out that he felt so shamed by his defeat at work that he wanted to atom bomb the world. He became angry and weak and frightened. He wanted to get away from everything and everyone. Yet he felt so helpless, he wanted to be taken care of like a child. He then felt hopeless and depressed. I commented that his motors had been thrown out of gear by the incident at work and this had precipitated excessive tension and anxiety.) W hen tension gets too great, and there seems to be no hope, anxiety m ay hit. And the person will build up defenses to cope with his anxiety, some of which m ay succeed and some m ay not. F or instance, excessive d rinking may be one w ay of m anaging anxiety. Fears, com\u00ad pulsions, physical sym ptom s are other ways. T h ese defenses often do not work.

If a general descrip\u00ad tion of dynamics is given the patient, along the 134 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY lines indicated above, a little insight may be in\u00ad culcated that can serve as a fulcrum for greater self-understanding. T h e insight may be tem po\u00ad rarily reassuring at first; then it seemingly is forgotten with a resurgence of symptoms. A review of w hat has occurred to stimulate an a t\u00ad tack of anxiety may consolidate the insight and solidify better control.

Conclusion In dynamic short-term therapy the most productive focus is often on some aspect of a nuclear conflict. Since the patient usually de\u00ad fends him self against revealing significant unconscious content, the therapist will have to arrive at it by observing its manifest deriva\u00ad tives. These may be highly disguised and sym\u00ad bolized. However, a sensitive and astute thera\u00ad pist will be able to detect vital undercurrent forces from the patient\u2019s verbal and nonverbal behavior, from periodic transference displays, and from dreams, fantasies and acting-out tendencies. These manifestations will be espe\u00ad cially prom inent during periods of resistance to techniques that the therapist is implementing. Accordingly, the therapist should alert himself to w hat lies behind the patien t\u2019s inability or refusal to respond to treatm ent interventions. A general outline of dynamics presented to the patient with the object of stirring up some ten\u00ad sion in the interview and hence expediting ex\u00ad plorations, or of working tow ard fitting the p a \u00ad tient\u2019s special problems and mechanisms into the outline, is sometimes helpful.

Distinctive fields of interest and special theories related to each link inspire a number of thera\u00ad peutic modalities that are preferred approaches in certain syndromes even though through feedback interventions bracketed to other links may also be effective. TECHNIQUES IN SHORT-TERM THERAPY 137 By the same token, practically every neu\u00ad rotic or behavioral disorder may be causally associated with multiple links in the behavioral chain. T hey too may be approached with a va\u00ad riety of techniques that correspond to different links. T h is is the rationale of eclecticism, which in short-term therapy is a preferred mode of operation. T h e fact that we have so many different a p \u00ad proaches to the same emotional problem can in itself be confusing. Because there is so little time available in brief therapy, we will w ant to select the one method or combination of m eth\u00ad ods that is most applicable to the specific diffi\u00ad culty. In this respect we can console ourselves in a minor way. No matter what technique we employ, if we are skilled in its use, have faith in its validity, and communicate this faith to the patient, and if the patient accepts the tech\u00ad nique and absorbs our faith, it will influence him in some positive way. In resolving a diffi\u00ad culty related to one disturbed link in his be\u00ad havioral chain, this will influence by feedback other links. T hu s, if we prescribe neuroleptics for a schizophrenic with a disturbing thinking disorder, the impact on his biochemistry will register itself positively in varying degrees on his neurophysiology, his general behavior, his intrapsychic m echanism s, his in terp erso n al relations, his social attitudes, and perhaps even his philosophical outlook. Applying behavior therapy to a phobic will in its correction influ\u00ad ence other aspects from the biochemical factors to spiritual essences. W orking with modalities that are directed at the intrapsychic structure in a personality disorder through psychoanal\u00ad ysis or cognitive therapy, we may find that all other links in the behavioral chain are affected in a gratifying way. T his global response, however, does not in the least absolve us from trying to select the best method within our range of skills that is most attuned to the p a\u00ad tient\u2019s unique learning aptitudes. Be this as it may, there are some general principles that are applicable to"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_223", "text": "most patients. First, we start therapy by allowing the patient to unburden himself verbally, to tell his story uninterruptedly, interpolating comments to in\u00ad dicate our understanding and em pathy and to keep him focused on im portant content. Sec\u00ad ond, we help him arrive at some prelim inary understandings of w hat his difficulty is all about. T h ird, we select a method that is ta r\u00ad geted on that link that is creating greatest diffi\u00ad culty for that patient\u2014 biochemical, behav\u00ad ioral, intrapsychic, interpersonal, or social. Fourth, we try to show him how he himself is not an innocent bystander and that he, in a m ajor or m inor way, is involved in bringing his troubles on himself. Fifth, we deal with any resistances that he develops that block (a) an u n d e rsta n d in g of his problem , (b) his productive use of the techniques we employ, and (c) the application of his treatm ent toward behavioral correction. Sixth, we try to ac\u00ad quaint him with some of the personality distor\u00ad tions that he carries around with him that can create trouble for him in the future\u2014 how they developed, how they operate now, and how they may show up after he leaves therapy. And, seventh we give him some homework that is aimed at strengthening himself so that he may minimize or prevent problems from occur\u00ad ring later on. W ithin this broad framework there are, of course, wide differences on how therapists with varying theoretical orientations will operate. By and large, however, psy\u00ad chotherapists with adequate training should anticipate satisfactory results with the great majority of their patients. Employing whatever techniques or group of techniques are indicated by the needs of the patient and that are within the scope of one\u2019s training and experience, the therapist may be able to achieve the goals agreed on in a rapid and effective way. W here the therapist has be\u00ad come aw are of the underlying dynamics, it may be necessary to mention at least some salient aspects and to enjoin the patient to w ork on these by himself after therapy has ended. O n the other hand, the therapist may not be able to achieve desired goals unless in\u00ad terfering dynamic influences that function as resistance are dealt with during the treatm ent period because the patient is blocked by the resistance against m aking progress. 138 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY In long-term therapy a dynamic theme that explains the patient\u2019s personality operations and resistances gradually reveals itself through a leisurely study of the patient\u2019s verbalizations, behavioral proclivities, dreams, fantasies, and transference projections.

{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_224", "text": "may have been given (e.g., m an-w om an draw ings and exposure to Rorschach cards), the therapist will be able to make some assumptions about the patient\u2019s dynamics. These will be a guide in confrontations and interpretive work. As has been amply illustrated in the past chapters, a num ber of dynamic themes, present in the great majority of people in our culture, have been repeatedly observed that can guide in bringing some basic problems to light d u r\u00ad ing therapy, recognizing that many configura\u00ad tions exist that are unique for each individual. Among familiar themes that have been de\u00ad scribed are those related to incomplete separa\u00ad tion-individuation, residual guilt feelings and needs for self-punishment, and devalued self\u00ad esteem. It is rare that one sees any patient in therapy who does not possess an abundant share of these leitmotifs, although the ways that they manifest themselves in the character structure and the kinds of symptoms they sponsor are distinctively idiosyncratic. W orking with the operative dynamics con\u00ad stitutes a valuable means of helping a patient to face and, if motivation is present, to alter his repetitive self-defeating behavior. Pointed in\u00ad terpretations of the dynamics underlying ego- syntonic symptoms, traits, and behavior only too frequently result in denial and anxiety, for maladaptive as they are, neurotic conflicts and needs are welded into the patient\u2019s habitual coping modes and yield florid gratifications compared to which the pleasures of healthy patterns pale. W h at is the best way of dealing with such obstructions? A pithy epigram in the Koran contends that \u201c God is with those who persevere.\u201d T h is certainly applies to the u n \u00ad daunted therapist who in the face of obstinate resistance doggedly works against it. In long\u00ad term therapy the task of dealing w ith re\u00ad sistances to a recognition of one\u2019s dynamics and m anaging stubborn oppositional reactions to the relinquishing of destructive behavior consume a bulk of the time devoted to therapy and can tax the endurance of the most resolute th erapist. In sh o rt-term th e rap y the task would seem tc be doubly complicated since there is only limited time to prosecute the search for conflictual themes and to resolve resistance to their disclosure and rectification. U nderstandably, one cannot duplicate in 10 sessions w hat could be achieved with skillfully conducted therapy in 100. Yet, experience bears out the value of bringing to the p atien t\u2019s attention a glimpse of his operative dynamics and dem onstrating to him his responsibility in bringing about the disasters that he has hith\u00ad erto credited to destiny and misfortune. Confrontation O ne technique that has been advocated by some short-term therapists to cut through resistance to understanding one\u2019s dynamics is th at of confrontation. T h is is som etim es utilized to get at underlying trends by pro\u00ad voking anxiety or negative feelings.

Negative transference rapidly precipitates out. O p p o rtu n itie s are thus rich for interpretation of feelings about and reactions to the therapist. T his technique is dram atic and often effective in patients with good ego strength. However, it can drastically hurt the therapeutic relationship in a good num ber of patients if implemented too early in therapy before proper rapport has been es\u00ad tablished. T h e patient is apt to regard the therapist\u2019s actions and m anner as arbitrary, unjustifiable, recrim in ato ry , m alicious, and reflective of the therapist\u2019s inability to under\u00ad stand him or to empathize with his suffering and situation. It takes a great deal of skill to select those w ho are suited for confrontation and to titrate the degree of forcefulness of challenges to the patient\u2019s existing strengths. Experienced therapists are capable of doing this even in the first interview with some p a\u00ad tients, but the average therapist will be com\u00ad pensated for his efforts with an extraordinary num ber of dropouts from treatm ent. In most patien ts w ho come for help a m in im ally provocative posture will be indicated at first; the therapist should work tow ard the establish\u00ad ing of a good working relationship before bat\u00ad tering away at the patient\u2019s defenses through strong confrontations. Selection of fruitful areas for confrontation when it is done is im portant. Since most pa\u00ad tients possess an overly primitive and severe conscience (superego) that provokes guilt, feel\u00ad ings of wickedness, and masochistic behavior, these pathological zones provide a productive area for attack and discussion. Some therapists em ploy a techn iq ue th a t in terp re ts the symptoms of the patient, no m atter w hat they may be (for example, anxiety, depression, worry, outbursts of anger, conversion reac\u00ad tions, compulsions, phobias, insomnia, anorex\u00ad ia, etc.), as manifestations of self-punishment, the consequences of a guilty conscience (Lewin, 1970). Each symptom is delineated as serving both self-tormenting needs and provocative aim s tow ard others. Even an in d iv id u a l\u2019s disturbed character patterns are reduced to the masochistic need to suffer and \u201c drive people aw ay so that he can torment himself with loneliness.\u201d T h e patient is helped \u201c to see what he w an ts to do and w h a t his conscience forces him to d o \u201d and how the disparity creates difficulties. T h e contrast between a healthy con\u00ad science that guides while inhibiting destructive actions and the patient\u2019s existing sadistic con\u00ad science that viciously torm ents and punishes is pointed out.

Since m asochism is a com m on defense, the therapist may not be too far off if its existence is pointed out\u2014 that is, of course, if the patient presents even slight evidences of its operation. Obviously, masochism is not the only basis for symptoms, and the therapist should not be sidetracked by using the expla\u00ad nation of masochism as a strategy for breaking up the patient\u2019s resistance. T h e therapist will usually discover, if a search is made for them, additional reasons for some of the patien t\u2019s symptoms. O ther explanations than masochism may be offered by therapists trained in specific schools of psychology or psychiatry.

Not long ago I attended a conference on short-term therapy where, to my astonishment, some trained analysts in talking about what 142 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY they did were naively practicing what Freud himself condemned in his 1910 paper on \u201c W ild P sycho analy sis\u201d (S tan dard E dition, Vol. 2, pp. 225-226) by confronting the p a\u00ad tient with aspects of his unconscious during the first interview.

I learned that a much better tactic was to safeguard the information for my own private enlightenment and not waste time convincing patients of my brilliance as a psy\u00ad chological detective. Once I had established a good working relationship with my patients (and it required more than one session), I could providently guide them with proper in\u00ad terviewing techniques tow ard coming upon the essential connections of their present topical behavior with fundamental intrapsychic de\u00ad terminants. T hey would then tell me w hat I had previously hoped I could smuggle into their minds in a flash.

T here are, of course, ways a skillful and ex\u00ad perienced therapist can in a roundabout, care\u00ad fully phrased, and empathic way allude to the essential dynamics by projective techniques such as those described by Arlene W olberg (1973) in her book The Borderline Patient. In this m anner one may avoid an escalation of the p atien t\u2019s anxiety or a hardening of resistance, which so often in prem ature interpretations takes the form of animosity toward the thera\u00ad pist and abrupt termination of treatm ent. For example, a young w om an of 28 came to th er\u00ad apy because of anxiety attacks and a dull p ara \u00ad lyzing depression. O ne of her chief concerns w as her 2-year-old child w hom she feared she was neglecting so much that he would not su r\u00ad vive. T h e disasters she envisioned ranged from accidental lethal poisoning to a fatal accident.

H er symptoms started shortly after the birth of her child and caused her to give up an excellent position in a firm for which she had worked since graduating from college.

A reckless therapist might reveal to the patient that part of her would like to see her child dead so that she can be liberated back to an indep end en t life and th a t she u n \u00ad doubtedly resents her role as a woman, which resentment started in her early tomboy days and accounts for her present sexual frigidity.

But this is the way the h u m an brain works: it operates by peculiar symbols and fantasies that do not m ean they will literally be carried out. TECHNIQUES IN SHORT-TERM THERAPY 143 W hat the therapist is doing is employing an example roughly and tangentially related to the patient\u2019s problem, but using another per\u00ad son as the target. If she is ready to identify with the example, the patient will begin w ork\u00ad ing on it as it applies to her and her relation\u00ad ship with her own husband and her child. If not, she will pass it by as irrelevant. In the for\u00ad mer instance, when the patient opens up, the therapist may gradually be more and more di\u00ad rect in his interpretations, titrating these to the patient\u2019s level of tolerance of anxiety while be\u00ad ing sure to preserve the working relationship. In the latter instance, that is, where the patient avoids the interpretation, the therapist will drop the subject and wait for a more strategic m om ent w hen the patien t show s grea ter awareness before engaging in challenging in\u00ad terpretive work again. In the case of the young woman just cited, my interpretation was com\u00ad pletely ignored, but two sessions later she brought up fantasies about the death of her husband, and we were able to discuss her feel\u00ad ings and to make good progress from that point on. In presenting interpretations the therapist should search for areas where explanations will be most productive and where the most resistances to getting well reside. Among these are nuclear conflicts, derivative conflicts, nega\u00ad tive transference; and sundry other resistances. N u clear conflicts frequ en tly persist throughout the life of the person and are responsible for symptoms and behavioral diffi\u00ad culties.

Recognizing the depth of the problem and the impossibility of altering the dependency need in a brief therapeutic effort, the therapist focuses on alleviating the separation anxiety with ego supports. H e brings the patient to an awareness of the origins and the destructive be\u00ad havioral residues of his symbiotic needs and through cognitive approaches helps him to fight off the urge for future entanglements with rejecting women. D erivative conflicts are closer to awareness than nuclear conflicts, and the patient has better control over them.

T h is is all to the good, of course, except w here the therapist attempts to incorporate all of psy\u00ad chopathology within his cherished theory and to insist that only his methods are valuable.

T . Beck (1971, 1976). In cognitive therapy an attem pt is made to rectify conceptual distortions in order to cor\u00ad rect the ways that reality is being experienced. Interviewing techniques analyze defects in a patient\u2019s views of the world (cognitive assum p\u00ad tions or \u201c schem a\u201d ), his methods of stimuli screening and differentiation, and the erro\u00ad neous ideas that mediate destructive response patterns.

Patients are asked to shut their eyes and \u201c to immerse themselves in past events by focusing on the contextual surroundings (colors, odors, noises, texture) of early experiences\u201d describing these briefly.

T h e proper response to these m a\u00ad neuvers, claims Suess, is to expose them as resistances. Some innovative attem pts at prophylaxis of emotional illness have been made. Among these is the work of Stein et al (1969) on brief therapy with seriously physically ill patients. T h e development of an illness, particularly of an incurable and debilitating nature, imposes a severe strain on any individual. W here the pa\u00ad tient is unable to accept the imposition of a tem porary or perm anent handicap, w here his security is th reaten ed and his self-im age damaged by the realization of his vulnerability, pathological psychological reactions (particu\u00ad larly anxiety, depression, tendencies toward denial, anger, and a variety of neurotic and oc\u00ad casionally, in those with fragile ego strength, psychotic manifestations) will impose them \u00ad selves. Because the patient may as a conse\u00ad quence become a psychiatric casualty, psychotherapeutic interventions instituted as soon as possible are urgent. At the Central Psychiatric Clinic in C incin\u00ad nati an early-access brief treatm ent subdivision (Stein et al. 1969) accepts p atien ts w ho preferably have severe physical problems of recent origin. U p to six sessions are given, each lasting from 15 to 50 minutes, spaced on the average of one visit each week. In the m a\u00ad jority of these patients symptomatic improve\u00ad ment and restoration of satisfactory functioning has followed this brief treatm ent (Gottschalk et al., 1967). T h e treatm ent process is best o r\u00ad ganized by (1) handling the tendencies to denial, (2) m anaging a shattering of the sense of mastery, and (3) dealing with the conviction of impaired body integrity. H andling of the tendencies to denial is cru\u00ad cial. Blank unbelief often operates as a pri\u00ad m ary defense to insulate the patient from the implications of his illness (Lindem ann, 1944). Such denial, interfering with the true assess\u00ad ment of the reality situation, constitutes a great danger for the individual. In coronary illness, for example, the patient may engage in d an \u00ad gerous overactivity, neglect of his diet, and forgetting to take essential medications.

Should the patient show resistance to enter\u00ad ing a group, this is handled as in long-term group therapy (see Wolberg, 1977, p. 706). At the first group session members are in\u00ad troduced by their first names and the confident nature of the meetings emphasized.

T h e focus should be on the present, and it is emphasized that no m atter what has happened to a person in the past, one can change if one has the desire for change.

Less hostile to themselves, they are more lenient with persons with w hom they are related. Cooperative and tender im\u00ad pulses emerge. A num ber of stratagems may be employed in the group to facilitate activity. O ne technique is to ask each mem ber of the group to talk about any fears he or she had as an adolescent. G ro up members often are able to talk more easily about past fears and problems, especially those they have overcome, than present unre\u00ad solved ones or about situations with an im \u00ad mediate stress potential. Patients can find comfort in listening to how other persons have had to cope with difficulties similar to their own. O nce past fears are aerated, present con\u00ad cerns are taken up about some common prob\u00ad lem. Should patients be on a hospital w ard, they may be questioned as to how each feels about a routine that some have found distaste\u00ad ful. Once the ice is broken and communication is flowing, more personal immediate problems may be approached. An interesting technique that may be used with patients who are not too sick, in a group that is inactive and bogged down, is asking for a volunteer to leave the room so that the rest of the group can talk about him, airing their im \u00ad pressions of the kind of a person he is. After a short period the patient is invited back into the TECHNIQUES IN SHORT-TERM THERAPY 151 room and asked to relate how he felt w hen he was out of the room, w hat thoughts came to him, and w hat he believes the group felt and said about him.

L ater when the group is more in\u00ad tegrated, the patients may compare how they originally felt about each other with changes in their perceptions.

H ere topics are chosen that deal only tangentially with the p a\u00ad tient\u2019s affects and conflicts. T h u s if patients wish to discuss hallucinations and delusions, a general discourse is given on hallucinations and delusions and not any individual\u2019s delu\u00ad sions as a personal problem. In a brief group therapy with the socially and economically deprived there are advan\u00ad tages in having the group composed of peers who can identify with each other\u2019s experiences and tribulations. T h e therapist is often re\u00ad garded as a representative of bureaucratic a u \u00ad thority, and the presence of persons with simi\u00ad lar socioeconomic backgrounds is desirable to lend support to the patient and to interpret w hat is being felt. Because h ospitalizatio n is considered as sponsoring regressive patterns and destroying self-confidence and social relation sh ip s, al\u00ad ternatives to psychiatric hospitalization have suggested family group approaches on the basis that the family is actively involved in sponsoring and m aintaining pathology in the presenting patient. At the Colorado Psycho\u00ad pathic Hospital a Family T reatm ent U nit set out to test the hypothesis that family-oriented crisis therapy has advantages over other m eth\u00ad ods (Pittm an et al, 1966).

Usually the crisis is brought on by a change in role demanded of one or more family members produced by some shift in the family situation. At the unit, work is done with the family to bring the members to a realization that the designated patient is not the only cause of the crisis and that a solution will not appear with his removal to a hospital. Rather, the entire family is involved and, therefore, responsible for bringing about solutions. T h e behavior of the designated patient is interpreted as an a t\u00ad tem pt at communication.

Combining principles from group therapy and family- centered educational approaches, the practi\u00ad tioner functions as both therapist and educator (Guernsey et al, 1971; Wells, 1974). In family therapy the therapist must utilize a much more challenging and confronting tech\u00ad nique than in ordinary group therapy since the interlocking neurotic family mechanisms are extremely rigid and self-perpetuating.

Biochemical, neurophysio\u00ad logical, developmental-conditioning, intrapsy\u00ad chic, interpersonal, social, and spiritual factors are all vital links in the behavioral chain, in\u00ad fluencing each other by feedback. N o one link is most im portant. Every thought, idea, wish, and fantasy has its biochemical correlates. Conversely, biochemical changes, including the influences of psychotropic drugs, resonate throughout the entire chain affecting other links. But while drugs may molify, it has been demonstrated that they will not solve the m ani\u00ad fold social, interpersonal, and other distortions that are ubiquitous. Actually, more people are being funneled back into hospitals in spite of medications than ever before. So let us give biochem istry and p h a rm a c o th e ra p y their proper due without encouraging the public to seek cures for spiritual, social, interpersonal and emotional ills in their local drug stores. In short, it is foolish to anticipate that drugs will ever replace good psychotherapy. C an you give ex a m p le s of w h at you m ean by eclectic th erap y ?

So doing will result in correcting rapidly a host of symptoms that interfere with psychotherapy. A second mode available to the therapist is diverting the patient and producing a calming effect through biofeedback or relaxing ex\u00ad ercises, like meditation, hypnosis, and auto\u00ad genic training. A third way is flooding the mind with philosophical, persuasive, or sug\u00ad gestive formulations, as in cognitive therapy. A fourth group of techniques attempts to divert the patient through externalization of interests, music therapy, dance and movement therapy, poetry therapy, social therapy, and occupa\u00ad tional therapy. A fifth mode is alteration of the environment to reduce stresses being imposed on the patient and to surround him with con\u00ad structive stimuli. Among the tactics employed here are guidance, milieu therapy, marital therapy, family therapy, therapeutic counsel\u00ad ing and casework, and supportive group ther\u00ad apy. A sixth mode aims at rectifying faulty habits and developing new and more produc\u00ad tive patterns through behavior therapy, role playing, and cognitive learning.

Passive waiting for the patient to work through his problem within a few sessions will bring meager results. It may be necessary to guide, support, exhort, and confront the patient as forcefully as is re\u00ad quired at the moment, always mindful of the need to preserve a w arm therapeutic climate. Activity in therapy may require ancillary serv\u00ad ices of physicians, lawyers, social workers, teachers, and other professionals as well as whatever comm unity resources are needed at the moment.

By utilizing the principle of selective focusing (Wolberg, 1977, pp. 366- 370), searching for evidences of transference and countertransference, immediately dealing with resistances when they arrive, changing from one technique to another when the for\u00ad mer proves ineffective, and posing challenging questions and confrontations, a good degree of activity will come into play.

In short-term therapy it is pragmatically necessary to circumscribe the num ber of varia\u00ad bles with which one deals during the inter\u00ad view.

T h e therapist m ay decide to work with one constellation, let us say the individual\u2019s present relationships, perhaps focusing on his immediate family.

Because there is so little time available, it is unproductive to deal with all of the random TECHNIQUES IN SHORT-TERM THERAPY 157 events and ideas the patient brings up during a session. Often these are advanced in the inter\u00ad ests of resistance. Yet there will occur incidents of great concern to the patient that on the sur\u00ad face have little to do with the area of focus. T o ignore these will indicate to the patient disin\u00ad terest and lack of empathy, apart from it being bad therapy. For example, if a core problem is destructive com petitiveness issuing out of rivalry with a parent or sibling and the patient has that morning found a lum p on her breast, it would be foolish to bypass the patient\u2019s desire to talk about the incident. Even lesser areas of trou ble preoccupying the patient should in comm anding attention challenge the therapist to find a connection with a deeper focal problem. T his can be done in most cases even though the route chosen may be devious. T h u s a patien t w ith a core p rob lem of passivity and lack of assertiveness, a product of incomplete separation-individuation, is intent on talking about an art exhibit he had attended at a local museum. U nderneath the great a d \u00ad miration for the artist is, it seems, a feeling of envy and despair at one\u2019s own lack of produc\u00ad tiveness. T h e patient may then be brought back to the core problem with the statement, \u201c H ow would you compare your own talents with those of the artist?\u201d If a therapist cannot find any connections, a question like \u201c W hat does that have to do with your own basic prob\u00ad lem we have been exploring?\u201d will usually help the patient resume dealing with more sig\u00ad nificant material.

Gestalt therapy is one of the many methods that if executed properly by a therapist who has faith in its efficacy can be extremely useful. Some of the techniques, like the empty chair technique, are especially valuable as a means of stimulating emotional catharsis, arriving at an understanding of suppressed and repressed feelings, and providing a platform for the prac\u00ad tice of behaviors that the patient regards as aw kw ard or forbidden.

(See also the preceding question.) W hat is the value of hypnosis in sh o rt\u00ad te rm therapy? Hypnosis is chiefly employed as a catalyst in psychotherapy. It potentially facilitates the therapeutic process in a num ber of ways. First, hypnosis may exert a positive influence on the relationship with the therapist by mobilizing the essential hope, faith, and trust that are parcels of every helping process and by cutting through resistances that delay the essential es\u00ad tablishing of rapport. T h is is especially im por\u00ad tant in detached and fearful individuals who put up defenses against any kind of closeness and hence impede the evolvement of a working relationship. Second, hypnosis, owing to its enhancem ent of suggestibility, will promote the ab so rption by the p a tie n t of positive pronouncem ents, verbal and nonverbal, that may alleviate, at least tem porarily, symptoms th a t interfere w ith ex p lo rato ry techniques. T h ird , hypnosis often expedites em otional catharsis by opening up founts of bottled-up emotion, thereby prom oting tem porary relief and signaling some sources of residual conflict. Fourth, impediments to verbalization are often readily lifted by even light hypnosis.

W hat are the p rin cip le objectives of d y \u00ad nam ic p sy c h o th erap y , an d how are these objectives reached? In dynamically oriented therapy the objec\u00ad tive is to bring the individual to an awareness of prevailing emotional conflicts, the defenses employed in avoiding such awareness, the way such conflicts originally had developed in the past, the influence they have exerted on de\u00ad velopment, the insidious ways they pollute one\u2019s present existence, and their relevance in sponsoring existing symptoms and complaint factors. Such clarification is in the interest of helping to face anxieties and to develop new ways of relating to oneself and to people. In \u00ad terpretations, the chief methodological tool, are targeted on defenses at the start, on any exist\u00ad ing anxiety, and finally on the drives and im\u00ad pulses that are being w arded off. Essential is the m aintenance of sufficient tension in the in\u00ad terview to create an incentive for handling and working through of the initiating conflicts. A most fertile arena for exploration is the trans\u00ad ference, which presents the patient with a liv\u00ad ing example of some of the core conflicts in ac\u00ad tion. Most vitally transference interpretation enables the linking of what is going on in the present with im portant determ inants in the past. Transference may not be displayed exclu\u00ad sively toward the therapist. It may be projected toward others outside of the treatm ent situa\u00ad tion.

T h e patient may then be willing to experiment with more ad ap \u00ad tive patterns. If no more than a placebo, then, insight can serve in the interests of expediting therapeutic goals. Obviously, the more perceptive and well trained the therapist, the more likely will the patient be helped to arrive at underlying etio\u00ad logical factors. But, however, accurate these discoveries may be, a tremendous num ber of elements other than insight enter into the therapeutic Gestalt.

T h e conception of punitive authority is altered, and softening of the superego results in strengthening of the self-image. T his, how \u00ad ever, is more likely in long-term than in short\u00ad term therapy. M ost people do require some challenge in order to change, and a certain am ount of anxiety needs to be tolerated to give up old habits and patterns exchanging them for unfamiliar ways of behaving.

A purpose\u00ad ful focusing on unconscious material can be most helpful in promoting self-understanding, which may then act as an incentive for change. Does one have to be a psychoanalyst to deal w ith resistance? O f course not. But the therapist who has no understanding of psychoanalytic theory and method is at a disadvantage in dealing with resistance. In my supervisory work I have gotten the impression that it is resistance that principally accounts for failures in the active approaches like hypnosis and behavior ther\u00ad apy. Referrals to me of a sizable num ber of pa\u00ad tients who were unable to achieve satisfactory results with nonanalytic therapies, revealed in practically every case that transference had in\u00ad terfered with positive responses to the th era\u00ad pist\u2019s methods. Such reactions occurred with me also, but I was soon able to detect them from the patient\u2019s associations and dreams. T hey then constituted the focus in our therapy. For example, in several cases referred to me for hypnosis by experienced hypnotherapists who were unable to induct a hypnotic state, I was able easily to detect the transference resistance that interfered with hypnotic induc\u00ad tion.

W e are more vitally concerned with another type of transference that acts as resistance to treatm ent manifesting itself in distrust, hos\u00ad tility, excessive demands for love and attention, sexual impulses, and so forth.

W hether it can be resolved depends on the skill of the therapist and the p atien t\u2019s motivation and ability to work it through. Sicker patients may require an extended period of treatm en t to overcom e such destructive transference. W here a therapist is trained to detect transference (e.g., by observing non\u00ad verbal behavior, slips of speech, acting-out, dreams, etc.) and deals with it by appropriate interpretation, it may serve as a means toward helping the patient to understand some of the deepest conflicts.

Antidepressant drugs, namely the tricyclic antidepressants (Tofranil, Elavil, Sinequan), increase the concentration of neurotransm itters at the receptor site by blocking their reuptake from the synapse. W hen tricyclic antidepressants are used, they must be given in adequate dosage (individually regulated) and the effects may not be apparent for 3 to 4 weeks. After the depression lifts, the dosage is lowered to as small a m ainte\u00ad nance dose as symptom control requires. A n\u00ad other way of increasing the concentration of n e u ro tra n sm itte rs in the b rain and lifting depression is by preventing their metabolism through inhibiting the enzyme m onoam ine oxi\u00ad dase (M A O ). Usually the response to the M A O inhibitors (Nardil, Parnate) is also de\u00ad layed. Psychostimulants like dextroam pheta\u00ad mines (Dexamyl), for example, are sometimes cautiously used in mild depressions. W here depression is secondary to anxiety, tran q u i\u00ad lizers (Librium , Valium) occasionally help, but because of the danger of habituation, tricyclic antidepressants or low doses of neuroleptics (M ellaril) are preferred. In prim ary depression complicated by anxiety tricyclics (Elavil, Sine\u00ad quan) are the drugs of choice. A patient taking antidepressants should be seen periodically by a physician, preferably a psychiatrist ac\u00ad quainted w ith drug therapy, where the thera\u00ad pist is a nonmedical person, since side effects are common.

Even if the therapist does not labo\u00ad riously work out the meaning with the patient, as in supportive and reeducative th erapy , dreams may still provide guidelines for circum\u00ad venting roadblocks to the most effective use of techniques. W hat are dreams? W e may conceive of them as images or fantasies that are an intrinsic part of normal sleep. W e know from hum an experi\u00ad ments that dream deprivation (interfering with dream ing by aw akening the subject w hen he show s physiological \u2014 R E M S \u2014 or electroen- cep halog raph ic evidences of beginning to dream) can produce personality aberrations. W e have learned a great deal about dream s from contem porary dream research. T h e R E M periods during sleep that are accompanied by dream ing have been found to be associated with activity in the limbic system, the primitive portion of the brain associated with the emo\u00ad tional life of the individual. T his lends em \u00ad phasis to the theory that the dream is a regressive p h en o m en o n . H ow ever, we are merely talking here of the neurophysiological activity that sponsors the formation of dream images, not of their specific content or signifi\u00ad cance, which may involve other dimensions than regressive emotional ones. Relaxation of ego controls liberates needs and impulses that, lacking opportunities for motor release, find access in sensory discharge. T h e content of the dream draw s from past im \u00ad pulses, memories, and experiences as far back as early childhood. T h e conversion of re\u00ad pudiated drives and desires into dream images sets into motion oppositional defenses and pro\u00ad hibitions that may appear in the dream in a di\u00ad rect or masked way. Immediate experiences and current conflicts participate in the struc\u00ad ture of the dream . It is likely that a happening in daily life that the individual interprets as significant serves to stir up im portant needs, frustrations, memories, and drives from the past. T h e latter, constantly dorm ant, invest certain im m ediate experiences w ith special meaning, alerting the individual to signals that in other persons would go unnoticed. Some years ago, I initiated a group of ex\u00ad perim ents in the hypnotic prod uctio n of dreams.

I found that hypnotic dreams could easily be triggered by immediate stimuli and that from the content of the dream one could not always identify the specific provocative stimuli that produced the dreams. T h u s bringing an open bottle of perfume under the nose of a person in a trance, with no verbal suggestions to influence associations, would in some individuals inspire a dream that revived memories of previous experiences. At different times the same stimulus acted to provoke dif\u00ad ferent kinds of dream content. For example, in one subject the perfume initially touched off a dream of being scolded by a maternal-like figure, the subject crouching in guilt. N o other dream s or fantasies were recalled. O n rehyp\u00ad nosis the subject was asked to redream the same dream and to reveal it in the trance. She brought up a pleasurable sexual dream , which was followed by a second punitive dream iden\u00ad tical to the one previously described during the w ak ing state. A p p aren tly the subject had repressed the initial part in the first trance, denying the content and reprocessing it by elaborating the punishment scene. T h e punitive dream might be considered equivalent to the manifest content, those manifestations accepta\u00ad ble to the patient. T h e repressed portion could be regarded as the latent content that the p a\u00ad tient could not accept. O n another occasion the perfume stimulus created a dream of w andering through a botanical garden. T h e mood of a dream also fashions the dream content. An upset patient during hyp\u00ad nosis utilized the sound of a bell that I rang to elaborate a dream of fire and fire engines with reactions of anxiety. At another session, during a quiescent period of this patient\u2019s therapy, the same sound produced a dream of worshipping in a church. A disturbed female patient at the beginning of therapy interpreted my touching her hand during hypnosis adversely by dream \u00ad ing of a man choking her. L ater in therapy the same stimulus produced a dream in which her father was embracing her tenderly. T h e dream content is additionally subject to changes of attitude on the part of the dream er. For example, a patient on being asked to bring in dream s responded with the following w rit\u00ad ten comments to this suggestion: T h e doctor requests that I dream . H e is inter\u00ad ested in helping me, so I better dream . In dream ing I am pleasing his authority, so w h y should I dream ju st because he asks me to.

Not all patients are so obsessively stimulated by a casual suggestion.

In displacement energy inherent in one idea is transferred over to another. T h is may take the form of project\u00ad ing feelings and actions from significant objects or areas to seemingly innocuous ones, and from whole to partial areas. W hat results is considerable distortion, which is particularly prom inent in the phenomenon of representa\u00ad tion by opposites wherein there is a reversal of the true m eaning of the dream. T h u s action of a kindly and concerned nature in a dream may conceal murderous intent. T h e individual often em ploys disguised sym bols of him self in dreams, clues to his identity becoming a p \u00ad parent only in his associations to the dreams.

An under\u00ad standing of the dream er, his problems, and the way that he conceptualizes is usually m anda\u00ad tory for a translation of the symbols.

Symbolism is an unconscious process or\u00ad ganized a ro u n d association and sim ilarity whereby one object comes to represent another object through some quality or aspect that the two have in common. In symbolism abstract and complex ideas are expressed in sensorial and concrete term s. S om etim es th e d ream symbols are recruited from the cultural and social world that envelops the dream er. At other times the kinds of representations draw from primitive language forms in which oral, excretory, and phallic components are p ro m \u00ad inent.

After referring the p a \u00ad tient to a neurologist and an orthopedic sur\u00ad geon, who similarly could find no organic basis for her complaints, the practitioner advised the patient to receive psychological help. She ac\u00ad cepted his advice readily and during the initial interview we decided on a short-term program . A working alliance was readily achieved, and the patient spoke freely about her early re\u00ad lationship difficulties, but she could seem to find little wrong with her present situation ex\u00ad cept for a feeling of detachment from her hus\u00ad band, a man eight years younger than herself about whom she spoke little at first. She was, she admitted, not truly happy with her rela\u00ad tionship, but it was tolerable and she did not believe she was too affected by it. It was better, she said, than her first m arriage to an au th or\u00ad itative man who kept her down and minimized her abilities, criticizing her incessantly. She chose her present husband because he was gentle, noncompetitive, and easy to get along with. But, for some reason she was not happy.

Case 4 Perhaps the most im portant use of dreams in short-term therapy is, as has been indicated, the signals that they emit pointing to the be\u00ad ginning development of a negative transference reaction that, if unheeded, may expand to block or destroy progress in therapy. W here a therapist does not encourage the patient to re\u00ad port all dreams, the patient may forget or repress them, and the only sign the therapist may notice that things are not going well is that the patient\u2019s symptoms return or get worse, that disturbing acting-out behavior ap \u00ad pears, or, worse, that the patient simply drops out of therapy. W here dreams are regularly re\u00ad ported, the therapist will have available a sen\u00ad sitive barom eter that indicates the oncoming of an emotional storm. A patient in the middle stages of therapy began coming late for a p \u00ad pointments. O nly upon urging did she report the following dream : P t. I w as asleep on a desk or table in your office.

At the end of 18 months of hospitalization she was taken out by her parents, and I was asked to see her in consultation with the object of deciding who the best therapist for her might be. A part from a slight emotional dulling, I could find no active evidence of schizophrenia, which was the diagnosis given her at the hos\u00ad pital. T h e dream she revealed at the initial in\u00ad terview was the following: P t. I was on a date with a m an and he proposed to me. I was frightened about going to bed with this m an. T h e n I saw myself suckling at my m o th er\u2019s breast. I felt nauseated and ran away. I felt em pty and helpless. T h e n I saw som e\u00ad body holding up two fingers\u2014 one represented m ale and the other female. Som ebody came along and took the male finger, and I was left with the female finger. I w as upset at being forced to give up being a boy. I had to be a girl. T h is made me anxious. T h e dream, which I recorded but did not in\u00ad terpret, gave me a clue as to her separation-in- dividuation, dep endency-independency p ro b \u00ad lem, and I decided that this would be the dy\u00ad namic focus in our therapy after we had worked out the time in my schedule. I saw her once weekly and I focused, whenever propi\u00ad tious, on her need for a mother figure, her fear of functioning like a wom an, and her problem of identity. After 6 months of therapy at the twenty-fourth session she brought in the fol\u00ad lowing two dreams: P t. T h e first dream was that I w as having an af\u00ad fair with a teacher I had in high school. (I had"}

D uring the in\u00ad terview I asked her to tell me about any past dreams, and she stated she could not rem em ber her dreams.

I was attracted to som eone there who seemed to change from a m an to a w om an, to a girl in her 20s.

W e dis\u00ad cussed her anger at discovering as a child the fact that she lacked a penis and her envy of males for their sense of freedom and inde\u00ad pendence. Although she fantasied functioning like a male, she stated that there were no epi\u00ad sodes of homosexuality. She fell in love with a young man w hom she m arried and bore a child whom she cherished, but she continued to be dissatisfied with herself as a wom an, believ\u00ad ing that somehow she w as damaged and infe\u00ad rior.

H er m arital and sexual adjustm ent improved constantly, and the image of herself as a female became increasingly consolidated. Conclusion Dreams, like conscious thinking, are dy\u00ad namically motivated by urgent conscious and unconscious needs. Because reality testing, logic, and correct conceptions of time and space are more or less suspended in sleep and because repression is lowered, the dream er may express basic wishes, conflicts, and fears that one would not ordinarily permit oneself to experience in waking life. D ream s may thus serve not only as a revela\u00ad tory screen for unconscious wishes and past memories, but also perhaps more im portantly as a way of reflecting present adaptive and problem-solving activities, habitual character patterns, and the special ways an individual is interpreting and coping with current situations in the present. D uring therapy dream s are particularly im portant in (l) identifying con\u00ad flicts and defenses toward providing a dynamic focus, (2) recognizing what immediate environ\u00ad mental events are so significant as to promote a dream and w hat meaning these events have for the patient, (3) understanding w hat is going on from the p atien t\u2019s standpoint in the relation\u00ad ship between the therapist and the patient, (4) detecting early resistances and transference dis\u00ad tortions that potentially can block progress in treatm ent, (5) determining w hat progress the patient is m aking in therapy, and (6) providing a window into the p atient\u2019s views of future problems and existing and latent capacities for adaptation. In working with dreams the therapist has a tool applicable in all forms of short-term ther\u00ad apy that can lead to a better understanding of a p atient\u2019s problems, to recognition of the quality of the working relationship, and to an overcoming of developing obstacles that threaten the effectiveness of the therapeutic process. CHAPTER 13 Catalyzing the Therapeutic Process The Use of Hypnosis In therapy much time is consumed in coping with resistances to the yielding of ego-syntonic patterns. It is traditionally assumed that this extended period is inevitable as part of the process of \u201c w orking-through.\u201d T here is, how \u00ad ever, some evidence that certain expediences may be employed to catalyze progress. One mode has a paradigm in crisis situations d u r\u00ad ing which motivation has been created for change that otherwise would not have de\u00ad veloped. Using this idea, some therapists at\u00ad tempt during therapy to create minor crisis situations for the patient by tactics such as ag\u00ad gressive confrontation and other ways of stir\u00ad ring"}

T h e object is to convince the patient that pursuit of one\u2019s usual mode of be\u00ad having is offensive to others and unpleasant for oneself. In this way the therapists try to break through resistances to productive change. In patients who are capable of countenanc\u00ad ing challenge and confrontation such methods may prove successful. Unfortunately, where a weak ego structure exists, where the patient is hostile to or excessively defensive with au th or\u00ad ity, or where negative transference precipitates too readily, the relationship will not sustain the patient during the tumultuous readjust\u00ad ment period. T h e patient will either leave therapy or show no response to the procedures being used. W ith such patients it is better to employ an approach oriented around a de\u00ad liberate maintenance of a positive relationship. A search for other strategems that can hasten the therapeutic process has yielded a num ber of interventions that have, in the opinion of those skilled in their use, proven to be of special merit. Such vaunted catalysts are subject, however, to variables of therapist p er\u00ad sonality and patient response that can negate and even reverse their influence. A mong the most commonly employed techniques utilized to accelerate treatm ent are hypnosis, narco\u00ad analysis, em otive release strategies, guided imagery, behavior therapy, Gestalt therapy, experiential therapy, dream analysis, family therapy, and introduction of the patient into an active group.* Certain ways of expediting insight have also been helpful, for example, citing specific epi\u00ad sodes from the treatm ent of other patients (of course, anonym ity is m aintained) that in some respects relate to the patient\u2019s problem. T his may serve as a projective technique to cushion the p a tie n t\u2019s anxiety and help m ain tain defenses that might otherwise be shattered by direct interpretations of the patient\u2019s personal reactions (A. W olberg, 1973, pp. 185-234). A n o th er m ethod is the use of m etap h o rs through relating stories or anecdotes that illus\u00ad trate points the therapist w ants to get across to the patient (De La T o rre, 1972). T herapists develop personal preferences in the choice of catalyzing techniques. These generally relate to their successes with the m a\u00ad jority of patients. In my own experience I have found hypnosis of great value, and I recom\u00ad mend it with no illusion that it can be helpful to all therapists. It should be experimented with to see if it blends with on e\u2019s style of w ork\u00ad ing therapeutically. * See W o lb erg 1977, p p . 2 4 5 -2 5 0 , 6 8 5 -7 4 0 , an d 7 6 1 - 823 for a full d escrip tio n of these m ethods. 190 CATALYZING THE THERAPEUTIC PROCESS: HYPNOSIS 191 When to Use Hypnosis Hypnosis is particularly suited for the p a \u00ad tient who is paralyzed by resistance.

Resistance is p articu larly obstructive when it blocks the special tech\u00ad niques that are employed in psychotherapy. Hypnosis may help resolve such resistance and enable the person to respond better to treat\u00ad ment. Hypnosis may be advantageously employed in the course of psychotherapy under the fol\u00ad lowing conditions: When the Patient Lacks Motivation for Treatment Hypnotic techniques may be helpful in con\u00ad vincing an unmotivated patient that he can derive something meaningful from treatm ent. A patient may feel resentment tow ard those who insist that he get psychological help; he may be afraid of revealing secret or disgusting aspects of his life; he may feel distrust for the therapist or refuse to recognize an emotional basis for his complaints. These and other obstructions that contribute to the lack of in\u00ad centive for therapy can usually be handled by a skilled therapist in the initial interviews w ith\u00ad out recourse to hypnosis. Occasionally, though, even skillful approaches do not resolve the p a \u00ad tient\u2019s resistance to accepting help. At this point, if the patient permits induction, hyp\u00ad nosis may provide a positive experience that significantly alters recalcitrant attitudes. For example, a patient who had great resistance to psychotherapy was referred to me by an internist. H e suffered from urinary fre\u00ad quency, which had defied all medical interven\u00ad tion and had become so serious th at it threatened his livelihood. H e resented being sent to a psychiatrist and announced to me that there was no sense in starting w hat might prove to be a long and costly process when he was not fully convinced that he needed it. I ac\u00ad cepted the patient\u2019s negative feelings, but I speculated that his tension might be respon\u00ad sible for at least some of his symptoms. I of- ferred to show him how to relax so that he might derive something beneficial out of the present session. H e agreed, and I then induced a light trance, in the course of which I suggested a general state of relaxation. After the trance was terminated, the patient spontaneously a n \u00ad nounced that he had never felt more relaxed in his life and asked if he could have several more sessions of hypnosis. In the course of hypnore- laxation I casually suggested to him that there might be emotional reasons why his bladder had become tense and upset, and I inquired w hether he would be interested in finding out w hether this was so. W hen he agreed, I gave him a posthypnotic suggestion to rem ember any dream s he might have within the next few days. H e responded with a series of dream s in which he saw himself as a frightened person escaping from situations of danger and being blocked in his efforts to achieve freedom. His associations were about the democratic rights of oppressed people throughout the world and the"}

W hen asked how this affected him personally, living as he did in a democratic regime, he sarcastically re\u00ad plied that one could be a prisoner even in a democracy. Since his father had died, he had been obliged to take over the responsibility of looking after his mother. Not only did she insist that he stay in her home, but she also de\u00ad m anded an account of all of his movements. H e realized that she was a sick, frightened w om an and that consequently it was his duty to devote himself to her comfort for her few re\u00ad maining years. These revelations were the turning point at which we were able to convert our sessions into explorations of his needs and conflicts. As he recognized his repressed 192 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY hostility and his tremendous need for personal freedom, he realized th at he him self w as largely responsible for the condition that was virtually enslaving him. It was then possible for him to help his mother find new friends and to move into a retirement village. W hen he resolved some sources of his deep resent\u00ad ments, his bladder symptoms disappeared com\u00ad pletely. M ore significant was a grow th in assertiveness and self-esteem that improved the quality of his social relationships. When the Patient Refuses to Begin Therapy Unless Assured of Immediate Relief of Symptoms Symptoms may be so upsetting to the p a \u00ad tient that therapy will be refused unless there is first a reduction or removal of symptoms. W hen symptoms are so severe that they create physical emergencies, as in cases of persistent vomiting, hiccuping, or paralysis, the therapist may be able to restore function through sug\u00ad gestions in hypnosis. After this the therapist m ay proceed w ith other psycho th erapeu tic techniques. In less severe cases, insistence on symptomatic relief may be a tactic for dem on\u00ad strating the therapist as a sympathetic person concerned with the suffering of the patient. Hypnosis with suggestions aimed at relaxa\u00ad tion, tension control, and symptom reduction can create an atmosphere conducive to a th era\u00ad peutic working relationship. Hypnosis can also expedite the learning of new habit patterns through desensitization and reconditioning (be\u00ad havior therapy). A patient who came to me with an obses\u00ad sional neurosis complained of belching and hic\u00ad cuping after meals. T his caused her great em \u00ad barrassm ent and frequently forced her to skip meals. She was so preoccupied with whether or not her symptoms would overwhelm her that she could scarcely enjoy food when invited out to dine.

W h at she wanted, she insisted, was sufficient relief from physical distress to enable her to function at w ork and in her relationship with her family. In light of her disappointm ent with interview psychotherapy, I suggested hypnosis as a possible way of helping her to achieve some lessening of her trouble. She agreed to give it a trial. T h e next five sessions were spent in teaching her how to relax and how to control her symptoms. H er response was d ra \u00ad matic, and her attitude tow ard me changed from suspicion and hostility to friendly cooper\u00ad ativeness. She readily entered into a thera\u00ad peutic relationship, and once therapy had started, there was no need for further hyp\u00ad nosis. When the Patient has Such Deep Problems in Relationships with People that Therapy Cannot Get Started A good working relationship between p a \u00ad tient and therapist is m andatory for any kind of psychotherapy. T h is is particularly essential in therapy that tries to bring about modifica\u00ad tion of a personality that is prone to anxiety. T his type of personality often feels great stress when the therapist probes for conflicts and challenges habitual defenses. W ith some sick patients the proper working relationship may never develop or may take m any months to a p \u00ad pear because of such factors as fear of closeness or intense hostility toward authority. R elaxa\u00ad tion during hypnosis may resolve fears, reduce hostility, and cut down the time period re\u00ad quired for the development of rapport. T h e p a\u00ad tient often feels an extraordinary w arm th and closeness tow ard the therapist even after only one or two hypnotic sessions. A therapeutic re\u00ad lationship may crystallize under these circum \u00ad stances, and it will then be possible to proceed with psychotherapy without hypnosis.

T h e poor wom an, protesting her innocence from the start, had become so confused by his confrontation that she des\u00ad perately tried to make up stories to cover tiny discrepancies in her minute-by-minute account of activities on the fatal evening. W ith a sharp eye for her inconsistencies, the patient had seized on her flounderings to trap her into an admission of lying, which then convinced him all the more of her infidelity.

Before too long he entered into a trance, during which I suggested that he would soon begin to feel more relaxed, secure, and self-confident.

Sometimes the usual unblocking techniques may fail to restore verbal com m uni\u00ad cation. In such an event hypnosis can often be effective, although the way in which it is used will depend on the causes of the difficulty. T he mere induction of a trance may uncork explo\u00ad sive emotions against which the patient had defended by refusing to talk in the waking state. Cathartic release in the trance may re\u00ad store normal verbal expression. If the patient\u2019s silence is due to some resistance, it may be pos\u00ad sible to explore and resolve it by encouraging the patient to talk during hypnosis. In speech paralysis (aphonia) resulting from hysteria these techniques may not suffice, and direct suggestion may be needed to lessen or elimi\u00ad nate the symptom. Speech disorders may be treated and sometimes helped by lessening ten\u00ad sion during the trance, and there may then be a carryover into the w aking state. W hen the speech difficulty is caused by needs that forbid the expression of painful sounds or ideas, an explosive outburst during hypnosis may not only release the capacity to talk freely, but will also open up areas of conflict that can be bene\u00ad ficially explored. A young woman, a severe stammerer, came for therapy because of incapacitating phobias.

T h e ex\u00ad perience opened the door to a discussion of her great concern over bowel activities. T h is was related to extremely rigid toilet training as a child by an obsessive, overdisciplinary mother who made her feel guilty and frightened about toilet activities.

T h e lesson learned can serve as the basis of new, more wholesome attitudes to present-day authority, attitudes that fortunately will in all likelihood make life more comfortable and productive. A patient who came for therapy entered easily into the hypnotic state but became more and more recalcitrant to suggestions. H e had always been submissive to his father (and later to other male authorities). Along with this he felt great inner rage, turmoil, and depression, although he was outwardly calm. It seemed to me that his entering hypnosis was a means of pleasing me. T h is was the customary role with male authority, patterned after the way he reacted to his father. \u201c For years, I hated my father,\u201d he said. \u201c H e couldn\u2019t stand being contradicted.

After the third induction she told me that she felt the need to keep her legs crossed during the entire trance state.

I reminded her of her g ra n d \u00ad father, she said, who, when she was a small child, had tossed her into bed and held her close to his body on several occasions. She had felt his erect penis against her body, and this had both excited and frightened her. It became apparent that the hypnotic experience repre\u00ad sented for her an episode during which she hoped for and feared sexual seduction. H er leg crossing was a defense against these fantasies. C ontinued trance inductions with the patient diminished her fears, and she then revealed be\u00ad ing able to have better sexual relations with her husband. Another patient, who suffered from periodic attacks of nausea, vomiting, and gastrointesti\u00ad nal crises, was referred for hypnosis after two years of traditional psychoanalysis had failed to relieve her symptoms. Because she tended to shield herself from awareness of her problems with strong repressions, I felt that trans\u00ad ference, which had not developed significantly during her previous therapy, might be im por\u00ad tant in helping her to gain insight into her problems. After she had been trained to enter a medium trance, I suggested that she would dream of her feelings about me. She failed to dream ; instead she had a hallucination consist\u00ad ing of a peculiar taste in her mouth, which she described as \u201c bittersweet.\u201d T h is taste persisted for several hours after her session. T h a t even\u00ad ing she had a nightm arish dream in which a wom an, whose handbag bore the initials B.S., took a small boy into the bathroom to help him to urinate and wash up. She was unable to in\u00ad terpret the dream . A trance was induced in which she recalled forgotten elements of the dream , namely that the sexes of the two p a r\u00ad ticipants had changed as they had entered the bathroom; the adult had been a m an, the child a girl.

Thereafter, she experienced strong sex\u00ad ual feelings toward me and shamefully asked if I did not have a preference for her am ong all my other patients. From then on it was possi\u00ad ble to analyze the origins of these feelings in her relations with her father and to see that some of her symptoms were associated with fantasies of w anting to be a boy through ac\u00ad quiring a penis. Hypnosis succeeded rapidly in allowing us to understand what was behind her difficulty. When the Patient has Forgotten Certain Traumatic Memories Whose Recall May Help the Therapeutic Process In some emotional states memories m ay be submerged. Because they constantly threaten to come to the surface, anxiety and defensive symptoms, which bolster repression, affect be\u00ad havior adversely. T h e trance can be instrum en\u00ad tal in recalling the repressed experience, and the examination of the associated emotions helps to eliminate debilitating symptoms. O ne patient suffered from periodic attacks of shortness of breath, an affliction that resem\u00ad bled asthma. H e was given a suggestion in hypnosis that he would return (regress) to his first attack. In a scene in which he saw himself as a child of 3 standing in a snowdrift on a back porch, he described how he slipped and fell into a high snowdrift, gasping for breath as the snow filled his nose and throat. W ith panic, choking as he talked, he told of being rescued by his mother and father. T his story was verified by his parents as a true experi\u00ad ence. T hey were amazed that the patient re\u00ad membered the exact details of the accident, and they confirmed that \u201c asthm atic\u201d attacks had begun soon after this incident. It was then es\u00ad tablished in therapy that interpersonal situa\u00ad tions in which the patient felt trapped caused him to respond with the symptom of choking for breath. T h is pattern had originally been es\u00ad tablished when he actually had been physically trapped. W ith this recognition, the symptom was markedly alleviated. When the Patient Seems to \"Dry Up\" in Conversations, Being Unable to Produce Any More Significant Material Periods of resistance may develop during the course of therapy characterized by an almost complete cessation of activity. T h e patient will spend many sessions in fruitless attempts at conversation; he seems to be up against a bar\u00ad rier that he cannot break through. Attitudes of disappointm ent and hopelessness contribute to his inertia until he resigns himself to making no further efforts. H e may even decide to abandon therapy. W hen such circumstances threaten, hypnosis may be tried to mobilize productivity. A variety of techniques may be 198 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY used,"}

D uring his illness she was able to have him all to herself for the first time. H er mother was only too willing to let her take care of him. Sexual excitement was strong during this period, and she harbored guilt feelings during and after her father\u2019s death, scarcely daring to think about it. \u201c I'm frightened. I know I felt guilty about my desire to be close to my father. After he died, I felt cold and detached. M aybe that is why I can't feel anything for men now.

Second, posthypnotic suggestions can be made to the effect that the patient will w ant more and more to engage in actions that are neces\u00ad sary and that are being resisted.

C ontrary to what might be expected, the adroit application of hypnosis can help some of these patients tow ard self-reliance by relieving their tension at points where they try to act independently.

In this way responsibility is tran sferred to the p atien t toward becoming more capable of self-determi\u00ad nation. Intervals between visits with the thera\u00ad pist are gradually prolonged. In the beginning the patient may resort to daily sessions of self\u00ad hypnosis because of anxiety. But as more con\u00ad fidence is developed in the ability to survive alone, self-hypnosis exercises become irregular, and finally they are resorted to only when ten\u00ad sions cry for relief. In many patients, however, regular relaxation exercises are an im portant part of adjustm ent and may be prolonged in\u00ad definitely with beneficial effect. In this respect a relaxing and ego-building cassette tape may be of help. T h e situations just described are no more than brief outlines of how hypnosis may be ef\u00ad fective in psychotherapy and only suggest the various ways in which the trance can be used as an adjunctive catalyzing procedure. Since all psychotherapy is a blend of the therapist\u2019s indi\u00ad vidual personality and techniques, no two ther\u00ad apists will operate identically. Each therapist has a particular philosophy about how people become neurotically ill and how they get well again. If a therapist believes that unconscious memories and conflicts are the basis for all neu\u00ad rotic ailments, digging will be indulged to u n \u00ad cover the emotional conflictual poison that has accumulated. O nce it is released, the psyche will presumably heal. Freud and Breuer origi\u00ad nally used hypnosis in this way and scored occasional success with some patients. T hey recorded th eir findings in Studien uber H ystene, the revolutionary book that was a precursor of psychoanalytic theories and m eth\u00ad ods. Although hypnosis used in this way may be instrum ental in releasing repressed memories, we now know that the majority of patients are not helped by this process alone. Interesting and dram atic as are the results, additional tech\u00ad niques are necessary if we are to achieve lasting benefit. T h ere are other therapists whose theories about how people become emotionally ill in\u00ad volve the concepts of faulty learning and condi\u00ad tioning.

Some therapists are not able to use hypnosis with any measure of success, either for personality reasons or because of un- resolvable prejudices. T his does not invalidate hypnosis as a procedure. Hypnosis, like any other area of specialization, requires particular abilities and skills. Not every therapist is able to am algam ate hypnosis with one\u2019s personality and technical training. It should be stressed again that hypnosis and any other catalyzing technique must be used intelligently within the context of a com pre\u00ad hensive treatm ent plan and with due regard for lim itations. A pplied indiscrim inately such techniques not only fail to serve a therapeutic purpose, but their ineffectiveness tends to dis\u00ad credit them as worthwhile procedures and to impede their acceptance.

W hen he married, there were some problems with impotence and sexual indifference, but his wife wooed him out of his apathy. But this seduction apparently opened up a pocket of oedipal anxieties. Occasional homosexual fantasies were not acted out. It is interesting that he began to rem em ber his nightmares which were patterned after the hypnotic dream and dealt with his fears of women. Soon he identified his wife in his dreams. After a quarrel he would almost al\u00ad w ays have a n ig h tm a re th a t evening. At around the fifteenth session he started com\u00ad plaining that his symptoms were not being relieved as rapidly as he wished, and he associ\u00ad ated this with the fact that his father did not help him much. T h e transference elements were exposed in his dream ing about me as be\u00ad ing ineffectual like his father. I interpreted his transference feelings, and the interpretations had a dram atic effect on him, enabling him to see how he was translating w hat had happened before in the here and now. From this point on we were able to establish excellent rapport. H e w as able to relate spendidly to his wife and his children, his w ork block disappeared, and his nightm ares vanished.

H ow ever, w hen certain blocks to treatm ent develop or w hen it is difficult to define a dynamic focus, measures to resolve resistance or to accelerate progress may be of value. H ere a wide range of methods is available, including confrontations, hyp\u00ad nosis, narcoanalysis, behavior therapy, Gestalt therapy, guided imagery, emotive release strat\u00ad egies, experiential therapy, dream analysis, family therapy, and analytic group therapy. Preference for techniques is generally d e\u00ad termined by the therapist\u2019s training and ex\u00ad perience with certain modalities. Resistance, of course, can also develop with these catalyzing interventions, and the manifestations of re\u00ad sistance may serve as a dynamic focus, the understanding and working through of which may be of consequence for both symptom relief and personality change.

CHAPTER 14 Crisis Intervention In recent years a great deal of planning has been conducted in the U nited States in an at\u00ad tem pt to lower the rate of admissions to mental institutions, diminish the incidence of suicides, quiet the outbreak of violence in the streets, and in general reduce psychiatric morbidity. O ne of the main developments tow ard these goals has been the evolvement of methodologies in the area of crisis intervention. T h e recogni\u00ad tion that crises are so common in the lives of all people has encouraged the growth of walk- in clinics, psychiatric em ergency u nits in general hospitals, suicide prevention hot-line telephone services, and a variety of other facilities whose aim is restoring, in as few sessions as possible, the psychological balance of persons in states of emotional excitement or collapse. W h at has become painfully apparent is that practically every individual alive is a potential candidate for a breakdow n in the adaptive equilibrium if the stressful pressures are suffi\u00ad ciently severe. A crisis may precipitate around any incident that overwhelms one\u2019s coping ca\u00ad pacities. T h e crisis stimulus itself bears little relationship to the intensity of the victim\u2019s reaction. Some persons can tolerate with equa\u00ad nimity tremendous hardships and adversity. O thers will show a catastrophic response to w hat seems like a minor mishap. A specifically im portant event, like abandonm ent by a love object, can touch off an explosive reaction in one who would respond much less drastically to bombings, hurricanes, cataclysmic floods, shipw reck, disastrous reverses of economic fortune, and m ajor accidents. T h e two im por\u00ad tant variables are, first, the m eaning to the in\u00ad dividual of the calamity and, second, the flex \u00ad ibility o f o n e\u2019s defenses, that is, the prevailing ego strength. T h e immediate response to a situation that is interpreted as cataclysmic, such as the sud\u00ad den death of a loved one, a violent accident, or an irretrievable shattering of security, is a dazed shock reaction. As if to safeguard oneself, a peculiar denial mechanism inter\u00ad venes accompanied by numbness and detach\u00ad ment. T h is defensive m aneuver, however, does not prevent the intrusion of upsetting fantasies or frig htening n ig h"}

W h e n this hap p en s, denial and detachment may again intervene to reestablish a tenuous equilibrium , only to be followed by a repetition of fearsome ru m in a\u00ad tions. It is as if the individual is both denying and then trying somehow to acquire under\u00ad standing and to resolve anxiety and guilt. V ario u s reactions to a nd defenses against anxiety may precipitate self-accusations, ag\u00ad gression, phobias, and excessive indulgence in alcohol or tranquilizers. M oreover, dorm ant past conflicts may be aroused, marshalling neurotic symptomatic and distorted charac- terologic displays. At the core of this confound\u00ad ing cycle of denial and twisted repetitive re\u00ad mem bering is, first, the m ind \u2019s attem pt to protect itself by repressing w hat had happened and, second, to heal itself by reprocessing and working through the traum atic experience in order to reconcile it with the present reality situation. In an individual with good ego strength this struggle usually terminates in a successful resolution of the crisis event. T h us, following a crisis situation, most people are ca\u00ad pable after a period of 4 to 6 weeks of picking up the pieces, putting themselves together, and 208 CRISIS INTERVENTION 209 resuming their lives along lines similar to before. People who come to a clinic or to a private practitioner are those who have failed to achieve resolution of stressful life events. In some of these less fortunate individuals the outcome is dubious, eventuating in pro\u00ad longed and even perm anent crippling of func\u00ad tioning. T o shorten the struggle and to bolster success in those who otherwise would be destined to a failing adaptation, psychotherapy offers the individual an excellent opportunity to deal constructively with the crisis. In the psychotherapeutic treatm ent of crisis situations (crisis therapy) the goal is rapid emotional relief\u2014 and not basic personality modification. T h is does not m ean that we neglect opportunities to effectuate personality change. Since such alterations will require time to provide for resolution of inner conflicts and the reshuffling of the intrapsychic struc\u00ad ture, the most we can hope for is to bring the patient to some awareness of how underlying problems are related to the im mediate crisis. It is gratifying how some patients will grasp the significance of this association and in the post\u00ad therapy period w ork tow ard a betterm ent of fundam ental characterologic distortions. O b \u00ad viously, w here more than the usual six-session limit of crisis-oriented therapy can be offered, the greater will be the possibility of dem on\u00ad strating the operative dynamics.

Variables Determining the Mode of Crisis Therapy Catastrophic Symptoms Requiring Immediate Attention"}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_339", "text": "Selection of techniques in crisis therapy are geared to four variables (Wolberg, 1972). T h e first variable we must consider relates to catastrophic symptoms that require immediate handling. T h e most common emergencies are severe depressions with strong suicidal ten\u00ad dencies, acute psychotic upsets with aggressive or bizarre behavior, intense anxiety and panic states, excited hysterical reactions, and drug and alcoholic intoxications. O ccasionally, symptoms are sufficiently severe to constitute a portentous threat to the individual or others, under which circumstances it is essential to consider im m ediate h o sp italizatio n . C o n \u00ad ferences with responsible relatives or friends will then be essential in order to make provision for the most adequate resource. Fortunately, this contingency is ra re because of the availability of modern somatic therapy. C onsul\u00ad tations with a psychiatrist skilled in the adm in \u00ad istration of somatic treatm ents will, of course, be in order. Electroconvulsive therapy m ay be necessary to interrupt suicidal depression or ex\u00ad citement. Acute psychotic attacks usually yield to a regimen of the neuroleptics in the medium of a supportive and sympathetic relationship. It m ay require almost superhum an forebearance to listen attentively to the p atien t\u2019s concerns, w ith minim al expressions of censure or in\u00ad credulity for delusional or hallucinatory con\u00ad tent. Panic reactions in the patient require not only fortitude on the p art of the therapist, but also the ability to comm unicate compassion blended with hope. In an emergency room in a hospital it may be difficult to provide the quiet objective atm osphere that is needed, but an at\u00ad tentive sympathetic doctor or nurse can do much to reassure the patient. Later, frequent visits, even daily, do m uch to rea ssu re a frightened patient w ho feels himself or herself to be out of control. 210 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY Less catastrophic symptoms are handled in accordance with the prevailing emotional state. T h u s during the first stages of denial and detachment, techniques of confrontation and active interpretation of resistances may help to get the patient talking. W here there is extreme repression, hypnotic probing and narcoanalysis m ay be useful. O n the other hand, w here the patient is flooded by anxiety, tension, guilt, and ru m in a tio n s concerning the stressful events, attempts are made to reestablish con\u00ad trols through relaxation methods (like m edita\u00ad tion, autogenic training, relaxing hypnother\u00ad apy, and biofeedback), or by pharmacological tranquilization (Valium, Librium ), or by rest, diversions (like social activities, hobbies, and occupational therapy), or by behavioral desen\u00ad sitization and reassurance. The Nature of the Precipitating Agency Once troublesome symptoms are brought under reasonable restraint, attention can be focused on the second im portant variable in the crisis reaction, the nature of the precipitating agency. T his is usually in the form of some en\u00ad vironmental episode that threatens the indi\u00ad vidual\u2019s security or damages the self-esteem."}
{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_340", "text": "A developmental crisis, broken love affair, rejec\u00ad tion by or death of a love object, violent m arital discord, persisting delinquent behavior and drug consumption by im portant family m em bers, tra n sp o rta tio n or in d u strial and other accidents, development of an incapacitat\u00ad ing or life-threatening illness, calamitous fi\u00ad nancial reverses, and m any other provocative events may be the triggers that set off a crisis. It is rare that the external precipitants that the patient holds responsible for the present trou \u00ad bles are entirely or even most im portantly the cause. Indeed, the therapist will usually find that the patient participates actively in initiating and sustaining m any of the environmental mis\u00ad fortunes that presumably are to blame. Yet respectful listening and questioning will give the therapist data regarding the character structure of the patient, the need for upsetting involvements, projective tendencies, and the le\u00ad gitimate hardships to which the patient is inescapably exposed. An assay of the existing and potential inner strengths in relation to the unavoidable stresses that must be endured and identification of remediable problem areas will enable the therapist better to focus the th era\u00ad peutic efforts. Crucial is some kind of cognitive reprocessing that is most effectively accom\u00ad plished by interpretation. T h e object is to help the patient find a different m eaning for the upsetting events and to evolve more adequate ways of coping. The Impact of the Family on the Patient T h e third variable, the impact on the p a \u00ad tient of the family system, is especially im por\u00ad tant in children and adolescents as well as in those living in a closely knit family system. T h e impact of the family may not be im \u00ad mediately apparent, but a crisis frequently in\u00ad dicates a collapsing family system, the end result of which is a breakdow n in the identified p a tie n t\u2019s capacities for a d a p ta tio n . C risis theory assumes that the family is the basic unit and that an emotional illness in any family mem ber connotes a disruption in the family homeostasis. Such a disruption is not alto\u00ad gether bad because through it opportunities a re opened u p for ch ang e w ith p o tential benefit to each member.

Crisis theory, on the other hand, insists that change must involve more than the patient. T h e most frequ ently used m odality, co nseq uen tly , is family therapy, the object of which is the harnessing and expansion of the constructive elements in the family situation.

{"id": "wolbergshorttermpsychotherapy_341", "text": "as an instrum ent of change. D uring a crisis a family in distress may be willing to let a th era \u00ad pist enter into the picture, recognizing that it cannot by itself cope w ith the existing emergency. T h e boundaries are at the start fluid enough so that new consolidations be\u00ad come possible. T h e family system prior to the crisis and after the crisis usually seals off all points of entry. D u rin g the crisis, before new and perhaps even more destructive decisions have been made, a point is reached where we may introduce some new perspectives. T his point may exist for only a short period of time; therefore it is vital that there be no delay in rendering service. T h u s a crisis will permit intervention that would not be acceptable before nor subsequent to the crisis explosion. O ne deterent frequently is the family\u2019s insistentence on hospitalization, no longer being able to cope with the identified patient\u2019s upsetting behavior. Alternatives to hospitalization will present themselves to an astute therapist who establishes contact with the family. Some of the operative dynamics may become startingly apparent by listening to the interchanges of the patient and the family. T h e most im portant responsibility of the therapist is to get the family to understand whac is going on with the patient in the exist\u00ad ing setting and to determine why the crisis has occurred now. U nderstandably there is a his\u00ad tory to the crisis and a variety of solutions have been tried. T h e therapist may ask himself why these measures were attempted and why they failed, or at least why they have not succeeded sufficiently. T h e family should be involved in solutions to be utilized and should have an idea as to the reasons for this. Assignment of tasks for each mem ber is an excellent method of getting people to work together and such assignments may be quite arbitrary ones. T h e im portant thing is to get every mem ber in\u00ad volved in some way. T h is will bring out certain resistances which may have to be ne\u00ad gotiated. T rades may be made with the object of securing better cooperation. Since crisis in\u00ad tervention is a short-term process, it should be made clear that visits are limited. T h is is to avoid dependencies and resen tm e n ts about termination. The Patient's Behavior and Its Roots T h e fourth variable is often the crucial fac\u00ad tor in intiating the crisis situation. Unresolved and dem anding childhood needs, defenses and conflicts that obtrude themselves on adult ad \u00ad justm ent, and compulsively dragoon the p a\u00ad tient into activities that are bound to end in disaster, would seem to invite explorations that a therapist, trained in dynamic psychothera\u00ad peutic methodology, may with some probing be able to identify.

Since the goals of crisis intervention are limited, however, to reestablishing the precrisis equilibrium , and the time allotted to therapy is circumscribed to the mere achievement of this goal, we may not be able to do much more than to merely point out the areas for further work and exploration. Because crisis therapy is goal limited, there is a tendency to veer away from insight therapies organized around psychodynamic models tow ard more active be- havioral-learning techniques, which are di\u00ad rected at reinforcing a p p ro p ria te and dis\u00ad couraging maladaptive behavior.

T h e basic therapeutic thrust is, as has been mentioned, on such practical areas as the immediate disturbing environmental situation and the patient\u2019s disruptive symptoms, em \u00ad 212 HANDBOOK OF SHORT-TERM PSYCHOTHERAPY ploying a combination of active procedures like drug therapy and milieu therapy. T h e few sessions devoted to treatm ent in crisis interven\u00ad tion certainly prevent any extensive concern with the operations of unconscious conflict. Yet a great deal of data may be obtained by talking to the patient and by studying the interactions of the family, both in family therapy and th ro u g h the observations of a psychiatric nurse, caseworker, or psychiatric team who visit the home. Such data will be helpful in crisis therapy planning or in a continuing therapeutic program . In organizing a continuing program we must recognize, w ithout minim izing the value of depth approaches, that not all persons, assuming that they can afford long-term ther\u00ad apy, are sufficiently well motivated, introspec\u00ad tive, and possessed of qualities of sufficient ego strength to perm it the use of other than ex\u00ad pedient, workable, and goal-limited methods aimed at crisis resolution and sym ptom relief.

W hy did the difficulty break out at this time? D id the patient in any way participate in bringing about the crisis? T ho ug h the latter may seem obvious, the patient may not see this clearly, but through interviewing and clarification he may be helped to identify the sources of the crisis and one\u2019s personal participation in it. It is im portant to be alert to how the crisis can be converted into an o p p o rtu n ity for change.

W here there is a preoccupation w ith these symptoms, an explanation such as the following may help: Th. W hen a person is upset emotionally every part of the body is affected. T h e heart goes faster; the muscles get tenser; headaches m ay occur; or the stomach m ay get upset. Practically every organ in the body m ay be affected. F o rtu \u00ad nately, w hen the em otional upset passes, the organs will tend to recover. Should the patient w onder why other people react less intensely to troubles than he does and blame himself for failing, he may be told that he can do something about it: Th. C hildren are born different\u2014 some are active, some less active. You have a sensitive nervous system, w hich is both good an d bad; good be\u00ad cause you are a responsive person to even nuances, but also bad for you since you react very actively to stress and suffer a good deal. You can do som ething about this to reduce your overreaction to stress. T h e following is a sum m ation of practical points to pursue in the practice of crisis inter\u00ad vention. 1. See the patient within 24 hours of the calling for help even if it m eans canceling an appointm ent. A crisis in the life of an indi\u00ad vidual is apt to motivate one to seek help from some outside agency that otherwise would be avoided. Should such aid be im m ediately unavailable, one may in desperation exploit spurious m easures and defenses that abate the crisis but compromise an optimal adjustment. M o re insidiously, the incentive for therapy will vanish w ith resolution of the emergency. T h e therapist should, therefore, make every effort to see a person in crisis preferably on the very day that help is requested. 2. At the initial interview alert yourself to"}

CHAPTER 16 Homework Assignments O ne of the most neglected aspects of sh o rt\u00ad term therapy is assigning hom ew ork through w hich patients can facilitate m eans of control\u00ad ling or elim inating self-defeating patterns. It is often assum ed that the lessons absorbed in the th erap ist\u2019s office will autom atically carry over into everyday life. T his cherished hope does not alw ays come to pass. T h e average patient generally dissociates the learnings in the th era\u00ad pist\u2019s office from behavior at hom e, at school, at w ork, and in the com m unity. A fter psycho\u00ad logically stripping oneself during a session, outside the patient puts back on the fam iliar neurotic suit of clothes. It can be helpful, therefore, in consolidating therapeutic gains to insist that therapy does not stop w ith the exit from the treatm ent room .

Ideally, it should start in the initial in\u00ad terview during w hich the lim ited tim e span is em p h asized. E ven though the p atien t im \u00ad m ediately accepts this provisional arran g e\u00ad m ent, later, as the therapeutic relationship crystallizes, its ending can pose a threat. T erm ination of therapy is no problem in m ost patients w ho are adequately prepared for it, or who are characterologically not too de\u00ad pendent, or who are seen for only a few sessions and discharged before a strong rela\u00ad tionship w ith the therapist develops, or w ho are so detached that they w ard off a close therapeutic contact. It m ay, how ever, become a difficult problem in other cases. Patients w ho in early childhood have suffered rejection or abandonm ent by or loss of a parent, or w ho have had difficulties in w orking through the se p a ra tio n -in d iv id u atio n dim ensions of th eir developm ent are especially vulnerable and m ay react w ith fear, anger, despair, and grief.

T h e question is often asked as to w hether sym ptom atic im provem ent by itself w ithout some understanding of the underlying sources of the current upset is sufficient justification for the term ination of therapy.
