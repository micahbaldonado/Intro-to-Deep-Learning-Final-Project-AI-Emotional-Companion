My own family could certainly have benefited from psychotherapy help when I was growing up. Unfortunately, my parents held the all-too-common feeling that you should never talk about your problems to someone outside the family. It was called \u201cairing your dirty linens.\u201d I remember hearing my Dad call therapists \u201cshrinks.\u201d The look on his face and the tone of his voice told me that he would never consider letting someone get a peek at what was inside him, his feelings about himself and the world. My brother got that message loud and clear. After all, he was raised to be a man, and men took care of business and did it without talking about their feelings. I remember well sitting across from my brother at his home in Texas as we were discussing the fact that I had started to see a therapist. He admitted that he was having a hard time with personal issues including feelings of being a bad father, wishing he could have a different career, but not knowing how to change work when he had four kids to feed. My brother told me he feared that he was becoming just like our rage-alcoholic Dad, because he found himself screaming at his toddler, and she had started stuttering. He responded, \u201cI can\u2019t understand why you think you need therapy? You\u2019re the healthiest one in the family.\u201d He followed that remark with something I\u2019ve never forgotten: \u201cIf a person can\u2019t handle his own problems, he doesn\u2019t deserve"}
{"id": "defining_moments_2", "text": "to be alive.\u201d It was one year later that he, a brilliant scientist with a wife and four kids that he adored, took his own life. I know from personal experience that some problems can\u2019t just be handled all by yourself. It was some time after I had begun to see the second in a series of good therapists, that I learned an important piece of wisdom. It takes courage to admit you need help and it\u2019s a smart person who seeks it. Dorothea (known as Dorrie) has deep insightful wisdom that comes from thirty three years as a therapist in fulltime private practice. She has gained a lot of experience in compassionate listening, being really present for another human being while setting aside her judgments and expectations. She views each person as her peer, respecting both special qualities and needs. This book is full of kindness, a deep sense of connection coming through each story. Defining Moments does four things. First, it offers real and practical help for people in need. Second, it wakes the reader up to the need, not just for personal support, but for positive transformative change on this planet. Third, she and the clients bring insights about what needs to change within our society now. The final piece that this remarkable book does is to remind us that we can and must place ourselves in direct contact with the intricate and energy filled world of nature; something many of us forget and some of us have never learned. This morning Dorrie called me while walking four dogs she has taken in as hurt strays. She takes the same walk every morning and today she was excited to tell me that she had just counted seventeen white snowy egrets and thirty-five geese who had flown in and were resting and feeding in a green sanctuary of the Los Angeles River. She told me that one of the geese actually came and sat close to her. I think this bird must have felt the sense of safety that Dorrie\u2019s clients feel. - Suzanne Arms, Author and Director of the non-profit Birthing the Future, (Birthingthefuture.org), Bayfield, CO INTRODUCTION I awake in the night and early in the morning with the feeling that we are currently living within an insecure shallow dark world that is hopefully migrating into a harbinger of positive change. This new beginning will be bringing forth greater honesty, integrity, competence, giving, caring, reverence for the protection of our planet, and depth of character within each one of us. I startle as mother nature plunges through the planet, challenging us with earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis, fires, storms, oil leaks, floods and dry heat spells, urging us on not to destroy each other and the earth. What can each one of us do to hasten positive change? What can I contribute as an author and Diplomate Clinical Psychologist with thirty three years in private practice? Arising early, I feed the birds, cats and dogs; take a warm bath"}
{"id": "defining_moments_3", "text": "to center my thoughts and plans. I walk four dogs off leash by the Los Angeles River where I can marvel at the wild flowers and count the gaggles of beautiful egrets, herons, cormorants, ravens, mallards, stiffs and gaggles of pigeons flying in a large group dance. Finally, I listen to the questions, wisdom and love of my preschool granddaughter on the way to her school, then exercise again with strength training. Then I am ready to walk into my office to sit quietly and learn from the hours each week dedicated to many different clients. They speak daily acquiring depth in their thinking so that their lives can thrive and they can also contribute to positive change. In the quiet of a therapy hour, we can share thoughts that people don\u2019t often say to each other in the real world. Sometimes we share a \u201cdefining moment.\u201d Doing this work is like being in graduate school for life. I\u2019ve had to write five books to research, integrate and consolidate my thinking regarding their personal and societal issues. I\u2019ve always decided to see clients with a wide ranging sliding scale because it does not seem fair that psychotherapy should only be for the upper middle class and the wealthy. However, there are still many people who have decided that they cannot afford therapy at any cost. This is especially true during a prolonged recession for fifteen million unemployed, elderly, disabled, minimum wage workers, struggling artists, families with special needs children, young adults and couples trying to find a place they can afford in an expensive world of college loans, high rents and mortgage payments. Defining Moments is my latest contribution to positive change; making stories, essays, and dialogues available to educated lay public who may be seeking, but are without therapy. Life can be hard. We all get knocked down, unless we lock ourselves in a room; but then we\u2019d die of boredom. Painful feelings are a rich part of life. The question becomes, \u201cCan I get back up again?\u201d and \u201cWhat did I learn in the process?\u201d Clients come to me because something is not working well. Together, we look at their life story, discover and honor the knockdowns, articulate unresolved issues, and straighten out any misconceptions. They come to understand how they chose to handle adversity in childhood. Often, the coping skills they needed to survive in their family of origin no longer serve them in the present. Therefore, we discover new ways to handle life and relationships. Finally, they feel sufficiently empowered so that they don\u2019t need to talk with me any more. A \u201cdefining moment\u201d is a moment in which something has just been said or demonstrated that is new and \u201cgratefully just right\u201d in helping to solve a problem about living. Some defining moments burst forth suddenly, as represented in some dialogues, while other defining moments come through slowly and are expressed in essay form within this book. Whenever possible, the defining moments have been printed"}
{"id": "defining_moments_4", "text": "in bold, so that the reader can retrieve them quickly, as needed. Some of the natural defensiveness that we all have to encounter has been eliminated from the dialogues to keep the reader engaged. I have chosen to write about those defining moments which have occurred in my private life in nature, and during my thirty-three years of practice encompassing some 55,000 therapy hours. These defining moments include issues such as understanding negative feelings, learning from nature, giving support, helping instead of punishing, insomnia, depression, building self-esteem, parenting, adoption, grief, anxiety attacks, male and female work responsibilities, defeating bullies, morality, affairs, friendship, helping others, and recovery from illness, to name just a few I\u2019ve stepped way outside of the mainstream, suggesting unique solutions to decrease aggression, and increase compassion. The recounted dialogues are only a small portion of any therapy hour. However, the knowledge shared between us has seemed meaningful, by itself, to clients in restructuring their lives. Each essay is meant to help people think about their own concerns in a new way, even though it is not a substitute for a therapeutic relationship. For those who feel encouraged to try psychotherapy, there is also an essay on how to pick a competent therapist and acquire a reduced fee, if needed. In the first section, I\u2019ve included some defining moments from nature and animals. Some of them have been reconstructed into nonfiction dialogues outside of the therapy hour. The second section is comprised of defining moments that encompass taking full charge of yourself. The third section shares defining moments created by the pets that have been working within my practice. In the fourth section, I consider defining moments about handling life, while the fifth section includes defining moments about children. Finally, a few more defining moments from nature make up Section Six. Section Seven, entitled Thirteen Wishes, encompasses thoughts that my clients and I have shared in regards to larger societal concerns that neither one of us could fix by ourselves in a therapy hour. Together, we have sometimes suggested changes that need to be made within the larger world, and ways that each one of us can contribute. Although essays have been grouped together into sections by topic, each essay can be read independently and randomly. Most clients choose to talk with me because of debilitating depression, anger or despair. We migrate through to depth as a result of understanding. The depth is richer than material things, and opens the door to making a difference which then produces a satisfactory life. I cannot claim that any essay contains an absolute truth. Instead, I describe only the thoughts and feelings that have been shared many times between client and therapist as helpful to others. My conclusions are my own, generated from my experience; they are not necessarily representative of psychotherapists in general. Some readers, I am sure, will disagree, which can be just as useful to them as long as they take the time to discover what they really"}
{"id": "defining_moments_5", "text": "feel instead. Each dialogue within a therapy hour has had any identifying information completely disguised, or is a recreated collaboration from many dialogues about the same topic. Therefore, any resemblance to any one person can only be coincidental. I hope that this book will be helpful to students who are in training to become psychotherapists. I suspect that Defining Moments may generate lively class discussions about the pros and the cons of what I have decided to say to my clients. Finally, it is my earnest hope that this book will be available to others, long after I have finished my work as an active therapist, by generating new thoughts, dialogues and resolutions for those who encounter essays related to a particular need. The more each one of us can conduct our lives not only successfully, but also with equanimity, morality and integrity; the greater opportunity we have to peacefully nourish, rather than destroy, both our personal, professional, global and environmental interrelationships. I DEFINING MOMENTS FROM NATURE 1 IF YOU ARE HIT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FALL It was dusk on the snow covered roads in the Colorado mountains. Suzanne was driving while enjoying the incredible silence of tall pine trees on either side of the road. Suddenly Suzanne braked as she heard a thunk and watched the vehicle two cars ahead of her swerve, correct and drive on, as if nothing had happened. The car immediately in front of her pulled to the side of the road. A young couple got out quickly. A deer had been hit while crossing the road. He sat on his crumpled haunches as if dazed by headlights, not yet turned on. Suzanne pulled over and got out of her car just as the couple was dragging the deer over to the side of the road, clear of any oncoming cars. Suzanne stood in the middle of the road, slowing approaching traffic. The young deer was wounded but not dead. He sat, frozen like a concrete statue. His eyes gazed nowhere. He was neither dying nor rallying, just stuck in shock. The young couple was also frozen, looking down at him, wringing their hands, dismayed as to how to help further. No one spoke. The silence was deafening. What to do? How to help? Neither Suzanne nor the young couple had a gun to put the deer out of pain. Suzanne called 911, and asked them to come to put the deer down. Since Suzanne was halfway up a steep mountain pass; it would take time for aid to arrive. It was cold. The couple hugged, reaching for warmth and intuition. Suzanne walked over to the deer and knelt to be at his eye level. She placed her hand gently on his neck, fearing what he might do since he was a wild animal. The deer did not resist. She gently began to stroke his neck saying quietly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Somehow it\u2019s going to be all right. Take it easy."}
{"id": "defining_moments_6", "text": "It\u2019s okay if you need to let go. We\u2019ll help you and take care of you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She kept each movement calm and deliberate to keep the deer from panicking. The young couple hovered at the edge, nodding slowly as they heard her words. The dusk was turning to dark; the snow continued to fall silently, sticking to the eyelashes of the deer who barely seemed to blink. Occasional cars and trucks drove by, oblivious to the crisis at hand. The deer stayed a statue; but his body was warm. Time seemed to slow to a snail\u2019s pace. Suzanne soon discovered a wound on his left side, however, the bleeding had stopped. Suzanne continued to pat the deer, repeating softly the same reassuring words. She did not want the deer to die alone because she knew aloneness deeply from within her own life story Suddenly, life came back into the eyes of the deer. He moved his head, sat up straighten Suzanne stepped back. The deer got up, gazed directly at Suzanne and then at the couple as if to say, \u201cThanks, I\u2019ll be okay now.\u201d The deer initiated a long shudder that reached into every part of his body. It was as if he was shaking off the trauma completely. He then darted off into the forest, never to be seen again. Would the wound heal? Had his life been saved by kindness, concern, and hope? The shock he had felt only stopped him for several agonizingly long moments. The deer would go on to fulfill his rightful place in the universe. The 911 rescue call was cancelled. Suzanne and the couple hugged each other as only strangers can when they have shared a precious moment. Suzanne climbed back into her car and drove slowly away. The warmth from the car heater made her body shudder from the cold she\u2019d felt standing still, so alone with the deer and the couple. For Suzanne, when life gets hard, the dark green-brown eyes of the deer come into sharp focus from within her mind. The story of our lives is not about how many times we get knocked down. Rather, it is about whether and how we get back up. Meaning in life comes from helping others get up and learning from them how they do it. That beautiful deer taught her to take the blow, to accept help from others, to stay with the knockdown until it\u2019s understood, then to shake it off completely, letting it go, with forgiveness, and then, to go on, knowing more. 2 TWO DIRTY DUCKS Oh no! I didn\u2019t like what I just noticed. My husband, David, and I were walking our dogs along the Los Angeles River, watching the mallard ducks bobbing for food in the water with their tails straight up in the air. Young male ducks in their emerald green headdresses flew overhead, swooping and skidding along the top of the water, looking to impress a new female mate. Dragonflies"}
{"id": "defining_moments_7", "text": "were darting in and out of river flowers. A heron stood watch, silent and still. Nature seemed peaceful and happy until I noticed two dirty white ducks clinging next to a fence with their backs to the river. They looked grungy, hungry and worried. They clung close to each other. They didn\u2019t even know that ample water with their wild feathered friends was only 100 yards away. A fond memory helped me to notice these two ducks. One Easter, when I was in my early teens, my father brought the same kind of duck home from work. We called him \u201cJay Robert\u201d This duck survived until Halloween night, then disappeared, probably captured by some Halloween prankster or eaten alive by a fox? I\u2019ll never know. I do know that I loved him and cared for him. My parents gave me permission to bring him into the house on occasion. He used to love to drink the leftovers from the glasses left on the lawn after an outdoor cocktail party, then stagger importantly back to his hideout. It was immediately clear to me that the two dirty ducks, in my present world, had once been owned, caged, and cared for by people. It\u2019s likely that they clung to the fence because it most closely resembled the cage they once inhabited. The ducks had apparently been abandoned to fend for themselves like the other wild ducks. However I knew that these white ducks could not protect themselves because they were unable to fly more than a few feet. They are bred for humans to eat, so they need to be fed. These two dirty birds were literally \u201csitting ducks\u201d for the band of coyotes roaming around the city looking for food and water. I was just starting a three-day Fourth of July vacation weekend, overtired from too much clinical work during the last two months of serving a flood of psychotherapy clients. David, was weary, too, from research grant writing at the university. He walked by quickly with the dogs, paying no heed to the ducks. When I brought them to his attention, he responded nonchalantly, \u201cThey\u2019ll figure out how to get to the river.\u201d I heard my own former therapist\u2019s voice in my head saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to rest. You\u2019re always helping. Let someone else take care of this one.\u201d This voice talks to me when I am too over-compliant in aiding others more than is good for me. Yes, I knew that there were many other people to help who biked and walked each day by the river. So, with mixed feelings, I made a half-hearted attempt to corral the two dirty ducks towards the river. They clung determinedly to each other and the fence. I gave up on them and went home. The next day, David and I walked the dogs in the park so I could avoid the dirty little ducks. However, thoughts of them wandered about in my mind. Day three came, and I went"}
{"id": "defining_moments_8", "text": "back to the river. There they were, still clinging to the fence, even more hungry, filthy and bereft since no one else had apparently taken any action. I felt bad and ashamed of myself. For the life of me, I could not remember what we fed Jay Robert so I began to ask friends and neighbors. I decided to start with bread and water. Avoiding the ducks was not right, and was disturbing my restful vacation. Twice a day, I went back to feed my winged friends. Immediately they gulped the bread and most of the water. They used the rest of the water to clean their dirty heads. Their quiet clucking told me just how thrilled they were to be fed. Soon they showed me that they recognized the sound of my car by chortling and running up close to the fence. They became comfortable with my presence. I wanted to take care of them the way I did Jay Robert. However, I did not see how I could bring them home because I had already adopted three abandoned dogs and four cats. \u201cSoon, those ducks will likely be dinner for a coyote.\u201d warned David, \u201cso don\u2019t get too attached.\u201d I promised to make some calls on their behalf as soon as the holiday weekend ended. I engaged in an inevitable hour of phone calls with useless prerecorded messages. One overworked Animal Rescue driver said wearily, \u201cI\u2019ve seven dogs to git to before midnight; we don\u2019t do ducks.\u201d However, I finally reached a person who directed me to a member of a Wildlife Rescue Organization. She agreed to take them into a flock of three other recently rescued ducks. She would have them transported, by her husband, to a lovely fifteen-acre ranch eighty miles up the coast of Southern California. I felt a burst of joy because this ranch happened to be in the small town where we would retire within the next ten years. We\u2019d purchased a little weekend vacation home there years ago. It was my favorite place to live. But I had to capture the ducks first and get them to her within twenty-four hours. It was time to ask David for help. He\u2019d been busy at work, high up in the ivory tower, preoccupied with a major grant deadline. However, he respected my efforts, came home early and agreed to participate in my rescue operation. David and I asked a neighbor to aid in the capture of the ducks, but he quickly declined to have anything to do with such a project. Instead, he helped us load the car. We gathered two large boxes, pillow cases to put over the ducks\u2019 heads, if needed, and some more food and water. David was now actively engaged. While I fed and played with the ducks, David wandered off down the path alongside the Los Angeles River. Soon, he had persuaded a gaggle of middle school boys, just hanging out with skate boards, to make a quiet circle"}
{"id": "defining_moments_9", "text": "around the ducks to help us keep them from escaping. Two homeless bearded men who lived by the river watched from a distance with interest. The ducks had already come to trust me, so I was able to feed them and just pick them up. I even got to hug one briefly. David took them on a two-hour drive in rush hour traffic to their new home, up the coast, while I went back to work for a prescheduled consultation. I enjoyed speaking several times by telephone with the two ladies who took these two dirty ducks. I thanked them for their warmth and kindness and sent them both a check for duck food and a donation to the Wildlife Rescue Organization. David and I were invited to visit the ducks in their new permanent home any time. After the ducks were safely delivered, I asked David what he planned to do at work the next day. He responded, \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to do, but nothing as exciting as those two dirty ducks.\u201d He, too, had caught the spirit and enjoyed our rescue. David and I did visit the ducks and a lady named Connie who cares for over three hundred wounded or at-risk cats, horses, rabbits, crows, finches, parakeets, pigeons, ducks and gulls independently, and with little apparent outside financial support. She lets recovered birds fly free but many of them prefer to return to her ranch. The two dirty ducks were fine, living with other birds in a large aviary that protected them from the coyotes. They were dining on lettuce left over from the flea market, dry dog food and water, delightfully clean from swimming in plastic kiddie pools. Maybe I just imagined that they recognized me with their same quiet chortle. The ducks will fare well, I believe. This is not only a story about the ducks, but also a story about a defining moment for me. It took some time just to watch the now clean and calm birds in comparison to their former dirty worried countenance. In the process, I gleaned that the only real thing life does is dish out opportunities. I acknowledged, once again, that not helping is painful for me and hurtful to others. Aiding others is not the chore I thought it might be, because the universe will cooperate and respond to the slightest invitation when I play my part with love and honesty. As I talked with Connie, I could see what a pleasure it is to interact with an altruistic and generous woman. Difficult situations don\u2019t need to be avoided. Rather, they are to be regarded as an opportunity to meet new people and respond in new ways. My friends are concerned about how to fight back against the dysfunctional and destructive forces of terrorism, corporate greed, scams, inadequate healthcare, and environmental plundering. How do we ensure a stable planet for our children? The problems are so immense, sometimes it seems that the only solution is to \u201cduck and"}
{"id": "defining_moments_10", "text": "hide.\u201d But perhaps it really is as simple as each one of us capturing more giving moments, of not bailing out when there is help to be given. Each time I go to the river to walk the dogs, I remember the two dirty ducks. They remind me daily to notice opportunities to give to others. Because, as Caroline Myss said in her latest book Invisible Acts of Power: Personal Choices that Create Miracles: There is no such thing as a simple act of compassion or an inconsequential act of service. Everything we do for another person (or animal) has infinite consequences. Every action gives rise to a ripple effect, just as a pebble that is tossed into a pond sends out wave after wave, widening and covering more and more space. Everything we do and say matters. Period, p. 95 3 BROWN LEAVES AND CACTUS BULBS Driving out of my driveway to walk four dogs in the park, I noticed a white flower that looked like it was growing out of a cactus. I made a mental note to check it later because I knew that kind of cactus did not bloom in my neighborhood. Upon my return, I saw clearly that nature was giving me another defining moment. The cactus had hard, stiff leaves culminating in many sharp spikes. Nestled inside this cactus were baby cacti and several white blossoms and blooming flowers tightly clinging together. The flower did not belong to the cactus. Instead, it was a bulb underneath the cactus that had somehow managed to send a stem and leaf up between the thick, unyielding spiked mother cactus and her babies. The stem had to contort itself, persistently fighting for air and space to accomplish this incredible feat. At the top of the stem were two white flowers and a bud still to unfold. I was amazed because I had never planted a bulb in that location. I was quickly reminded that nature does not make excuses. Instead nature makes a plan and tries it out without fear of failure. It either succeeds or fails. We all have good ideas and plans. However, only sometimes, do humans beings follow through into action to succeed, like this bulb. More often we have an insight, then we come up with an excuse that makes it impossible to follow through with an otherwise extraordinary plan. I took a picture of the cactus and the bulb intertwined so I could savor this beautiful message from nature. Next, I went to the flower store to get some plant food for my garden. After paying, I noticed on the counter a six inch ball of completely brown leaves that looked like they had come from a dead cedar tree. They were selling for $6.00. I asked the employee, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d He directed me, \u201cTake it home and put it in a bowl of water. Within 24-36 hours it will turn green. Keep it in water for two weeks and then plant"}
{"id": "defining_moments_11", "text": "it in bright light. It will then last forever.\u201d I took it home and did as I was told. The leaves, within 24 hours, unfurled and turned dark green, opening up completely to receive the light. It was beautiful. I put it in the ground and the roots grabbed hold. But the plant faced another crisis when a puppy dug it up. I put it back into water, and again the leaves unfolded in dark green color. It was a reminder that growth can occur even when the situation looks and feels completely hopeless. I showed both pieces of nature to a couple expecting a child, who had come to visit. They had used drugs. Several friends had helped them to rebuild their lives by providing medical care, shelter, some financial support, a training program, and a job that culminated in a second chance to launch a productive life. This couple accepted and made good use of the help given and were free of illegal drug use for a year. They were building a new life to receive their baby. I showed the cacti, the bulb and the dead ball of brown cedar leaves to this couple. I offered, \u201cThese two plants remind me of you. The cactus is your former difficult life with drugs; the flowers are you pulling away from the drugs to have your own life back again. You have done what the bulb did. Both you and the bulb are miraculous.\u201d The father-to-be responded, \u201cOne flower is me, the other flower is the mother of my baby. The baby is represented by the bud.\u201d I added, \u201cThe friends who helped you are like the water in the dish where the brown cedar leaves were placed.\u201d \u201dYeah,\u201d he added slowly. \u201cAwesome.\u201d Some of my clients have furled, broken, or undernourished colorless leaves. However, with the right amount of understanding and support that comes from a competent psychotherapy dialogue, they are able to turn green and bloom. That is all it takes. The bulb bloomed once more a year later, again from underneath and inside the cactus. Another cactus broke through a piece of concrete, reminding me that some of my own excuses are indeed, flimsy. II DEFINING MOMENTS IN TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF 4 \"TO BE OR NOT TO BE... THAT IS THE QUESTION.\" OR \u201cTO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE \u201d THE UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY OF THIS PSYCHOTHERAPIST Clients make the first phone call to me for a psychotherapy appointment. Often they say, \u201cI want to come to see you because I\u2019m not happy with my life.\u201d We make an initial evaluation appointment to speak together to see if I have the expertise they need for me to be of help. I look for a \u201csuccessful life\u201d with meaning rather than \u201cbeing happy\u201d because I see \u201chappy\u201d as only one of many valuable emotions. For example, one day I met with five different clients. At the end of the day, I reviewed my work with them, heard"}
{"id": "defining_moments_12", "text": "some remarks of appreciation, and decided that it was a \u201csuccessful\u201d day. I\u2019d helped each one of them in a real way. Out of that experience came many different feelings. I felt enormous frustration and pain as I heard about the cruelty that had happened to one of my clients. I felt a depth of sadness, creativity and insight that led me to write this essay, resulting in a sense of completion and peace. I don\u2019t remember actually feeling \u201chappy.\u201d However, I appreciated the other emotions because they gave direction and meaning to my life. We tend to think of \u201chappiness\u201d in relation to \u201cgetting what we want.\u201d As I observe the clients in my office, I see that \u201chappiness is figuring out who we are.\u201d Everyone is born with both strengths and vulnerabilities. Perfect parenting is not possible. Therefore, every life story has deficits, knockdowns, strengths and growth in recovery. The importance of each experience lies in understanding what knocked us down, and how to get back up again. Every new parent hopes to be the first person to do perfect parenting, yet no one has succeeded. Realistically, we can consider that perfect parenting would leave a child woefully unprepared to handle the knockdowns of real life. As Mary Pipher said in Writing to Change the World, \u201cDarkness is part of the great \u2019suchness\u2019 of the universe.\u201d A crisis is not to be avoided because it\u2019s an opportunity as well as a danger. Countless times, I have seen that a new opportunity lies waiting behind a client\u2019s misfortune. Many of us experience trauma. Our task is to decide whether to live life forever narrowly, as a dysfunctional \u201cvictim,\u201d or accept the trauma as a learning challenge, mastering it with pride. Trauma presents the opportunity for us to dig down deep below the surface of our awareness where true inner richness lies, and then create the necessary ingredients for renewal. In the process, we become comfortable with fear so that we can handle it next time. Difficulty with life and depth of character go hand in hand; our misfortune and strife often lead us directly towards the very way we are meant to make a viable creative difference in the world. However, it may take many years to assemble all of the pieces that make up the total picture. A life without trauma and difficulty may be a shallow life. When we haven\u2019t understood our knockdowns, we can be incredibly cruel to each other by displaying our own unresolved issues with misconceptions, inner pain, despair, violence, and greed. Much of our dysfunctional behavior stems from unsorted previous hurt, denial, ignorance, confusion, loss and distorted memories of experiences, resulting in lack of mastery of life. We owe it to ourselves and others to understand. As a psychotherapist, I see suffering up close and personal. My office walls are three inches thick with the emotions left behind from the intentional and unintentional hurts heaped upon client after client. Sometimes the only thing"}
{"id": "defining_moments_13", "text": "I can say that makes any sense is, \u201cThere must be an intelligence to the universe that humans are simply not bright enough to begin to understand in the moment. Perhaps we are like ants trying to avoid being extinguished under the huge foot of a universal knowledge about the past, present, and future.\u201d Throughout history we have fought wars repeatedly in an attempt to prove that one religion or culture knows more and is better than another. Some seek one religion that explains everything with God in charge \u201cup there,\u201d watching us all of the time to make sure that we will be \u201csaved in heaven\u201d if we are good, and \u201cdamned to hell\u201d if we fail. Some obey specific rules, hoping to be favored and recognized. Religion is an attempt to articulate universal truths we can\u2019t truly comprehend and is, for me, an artificial oversimplification, at best. However, I do sense an enormous energy and order within the universe. Perhaps there is a plan for all of us individually and collectively that we must ferret out over a life time. It seems as if the universe nudges each one of us at a particular time in a way that comes to light during the psychotherapy hour. One of the most magical facts about the universe is that there are no human duplicates. There never has been, nor will there be, another person like myself or any one of my clients. Therefore, each client has to make a unique decision about what to do with their life and how to make a difference. No one else knows; significant others can only observe and suggest. Sometimes a significant others\u2019 threat and jealousy can promote inaccurate advice. The vast variety of individual strengths and talents on this planet covers every kind of job that needs to be done. Each one of us has the responsibility of figuring out our special talents for the purpose of making our contribution. Every job is of equal value to maintaining the whole universe. Sometimes I indulge in the fantasy of a world in which we all get paid the same salary for whatever job we do. There are two opposite positive forces within each person that need to be balanced with each other. There is a force to be still, to do nothing except be in the present, rest, relax, sleep, meditate, and rejuvenate. The other force motivates us to do something concrete, to be insightful, creative and effective in contributing something meaningful to someone else or to the survival of the planet. Both forces are necessary to conduct life. If we can keep these two forces balanced with each other, we can be truly effective. Realistically, we can only make a plan as to what to do with life that encompasses five to seven years because there are so many unexpected turns. As we like to say, \u201cLife happens while we\u2019re making other plans.\u201d However, we can be guided superbly by reading both our"}
{"id": "defining_moments_14", "text": "positive and negative feelings. When we ignore our negative feelings with defense or addiction, we lose the power to make effective judgments over time. Unacknowledged emotions fester while weakening us instead of fading away. They leave us, too often, with confusion, and unacceptable plans and behavior toward others. To mature is to catch the energy that makes plants grow and birds sing. Creativity, as a strength by itself, may appear, but generally it emerges more fully out of a struggle. Only then is there something to say. The universe sends us problems and difficulties so that we can grapple with them and pass on what we have learned to others. Nature also gives much for which to be thankful. Knowing intimately what we have been given helps us decide and commit to what we need to give back to keep the planet flourishing for the next generation. We can have a successful meaningful life that is still open to feeling all kinds of emotions. We can die in peace when we have figured out how we are supposed to make a difference, knowing that we have used our best talents to complete the task. At funerals, the participants address what the deceased have given, not what they have amassed or acquired. As Mark Morford, San Francisco Gate Columnist, wrote on January 3, 2007: Our spirits, for whatever unqualified reason, chose to suffer and scream, and pain and joy and come, and lick and try to love because, well, because we have so much to learn. Because this is what we do. Because this planet is one of the most difficult and challenging and brutal schoolrooms in the universe. In fact, the divine (universe) is dirty, beautiful, ugly, sad, tragic, and gorgeous and sticky and mean and deadly and orgasmic and exhausting, all at once. 5 WHO DO WE NEED TO PLEASE ANYWAY? ESPECIALLY FOR PERSONS WITH SEVERELY CRITICAL PARENTS Sometimes I have a client in my office who feels defeated in terms of receiving approval from others. They believe that there is some way to act that everyone will like. If they can\u2019t figure it out, they\u2019re \u201cworthless.\u201d We consider together the following story. I begin by asking, \u201cWhat do you think would happen if I invited 100 prospective clients to come in and look at the decor of my office and let me know what they think of it?\u201d Each and every client looks at me blankly, shrugs a shoulder and waits for me to proceed. I answer, \u201cI believe the following would happen. One third of them would say, \u2019I like it. I love to look out the window and see the lake with the seagulls sitting on the water. I like the pastel colors, antique furniture, the little miniatures around the room, and the quiet landscape paintings on the wall. I love visiting with the cat and the dogs when they\u2019re around, and seeing the plants and bouquet of flowers. I would be happy to do some"}
{"id": "defining_moments_15", "text": "work with you here.\u2019 \u201cAnother third of my visitors would look up blankly and say, Ahhh ... to be honest... I hadn\u2019t really noticed one way or the other, but maybe you could be of help to me.\u2019 \u201cThe last third would say, \u2019I don\u2019t like your office. I hate the color yellow. I prefer bright colors and modern furniture. It\u2019s not professional looking enough for me. I prefer validated parking, separate exit and entrance, elevators, and more of a professional office look. This is not the right place for me to be.\u2019 Those clients move on to a therapist in a big office building.\u201d Each client looks surprised and a little relieved as I finish the story. I add, \u201cI\u2019ve made this room for me because I\u2019m the person who has to spend the most time here. It\u2019s my favorite room, but I don\u2019t expect others to agree with me all of the time. If I invited one thousand people to assess the office, the results would still be the same.\u201d I continue, \u201cWe\u2019re lucky if we can please, help or aid one third of the people some of the time. The best you can do is to find out who you are, do it and be honest about it. Then, you will attract other people who think, feel, believe and have the same talents and interests you do. There are enough people out there who like this room and the work I do for me to have a practice for a lifetime.\u201d Finally, I say, \u201cSo, how does this story relate to you? You can decide what you want to do with your life, what you prefer in terms of decor. Those who like it will stick around, the others will go away. You don\u2019t have to please everyone all of the time; perfection is impossible. You can just be who you really are, even if people who are significant in your life don\u2019t like it. You and I can work together to figure out who you want to be.\u201d By this time, the client has relaxed, and is beginning to get that far-a-way look that seems to mean that they\u2019re already looking into a future that will become uniquely their own. I invite them to share their thoughts and we begin our journey together to locate the unique self that only they can be. 6 BUILDING AN INTROJECT A new psychology intern showed up for the first hour of her training psychotherapy. She is participating in her own personal therapy as one important requirement of her graduate training program. She can choose her own experienced therapist, seeing the therapy process up close and personal, while, at the same time, tackling her own unresolved issues. She wasted no time in going right to work. \u201cWhat does psychotherapy do?\u201d \u201cPsychotherapy does a lot of things, but one of the most important is slowly and carefully building a new introject.\u201d \u201cSo ... what, pray tell, is an introject?\u201d \u201cAn introject"}
{"id": "defining_moments_16", "text": "is the compilation of memories that you have acquired from experiencing a significant relationship. It holds the summary messages from that person.\u201d \u201cSo I would be coming in here with an introject from my mother and my father?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s correct. We\u2019ll be looking at the positive, negative and confusing messages you may have received from them about living life.\u201d \u201cI already know that stuff. So what will that do for me?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see if there are any misconceptions that may need to be cleared up for you; and, at the same time, we\u2019ll be building a new introject from me.\u201d \u201cWhat will that accomplish?\u201d \u201cThis introject will be thoughtfully built out of the conversations that you and I have together. Each week, in between psychotherapy hours, it will be there more and more clearly for you to check in and read any time you want. If you and I do our job well, this new introject will sit in your head beside the other introjects, holding some new empowering messages to guide you through life.\u201d \u201cSo when I feel lonely, or wish our appointment were sooner, or want to talk with you on the telephone, I could check in with this new introject first and see what you have to say?\u201d \u201cPrecisely. In fact, you can even imagine me two inches high on your left shoulder in the outfit I wear that you like the best. You can have any conversation you want with me privately. If you ask me a question, you will come up with an answer because you\u2019ve been here for every hour we\u2019ve done together. If you can\u2019t get an answer, and you have to make a decision quickly about something important; you can still call me up because I\u2019m now responsible for your psychological care.\u201d \u201cWhat does the therapist have to do to build that new introject for me?\u201d I responded, \u201cAll therapists have their own unique process. Personally, I create a positive introject in many different ways. First of all, I try my best at all times to be kind to you. Judging you is off limits. Since I\u2019m always on call for emergencies, I never allow myself to be high on any substance. Therefore, my mind is clear at all times and my judgment is not impaired. I make every effort to be on time and acknowledge your presence when I first see you come in. When and if I make a mistake, we will talk about it together as a means of correcting it, and making amends.\u201d I continued, \u201cIn addition, I\u2019ve created an office with a lake view and lots of warm colors to help both of us feel calm and peaceful. When I sit down to talk with you, I relax completely and let everything else be quiet in my head so that I can listen to you without distraction. Therefore, the hour is entirely yours. I have well-trained cats and dogs who will greet you, treat you with great"}

I bring flowers and blooming plants where we can both see their beauty and smell their fragrance. Birds and squirrels are on the office back porch to remind us that nature, filled with the energy of the universe, is there to help us grow. Prisms generate rainbows around the room from the afternoon sunshine while we look together for the understanding and interpretations that will feel like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow nearest to you. We work together keeping painful feelings in small manageable pieces.\u201d \u201cHow do I know what to say to you first?\u201d \u201cYou already knew what question to start with today. It is as if you have brought your life story in a puzzle box of 250 pieces. I help you to put together the unique picture of your life story on the wall. We will only do the parts that you want to fill in. Some days it will feel like we have laid out a bunch of pieces that don\u2019t fit together. Other days, they will suddenly attach to each other to make a vivid picture. As an artist, I have some experience with locating the central themes of each picture. We\u2019ll look together, with respect, to see how you coped in childhood. We may decide to alter some behaviors for a different present and future. We\u2019ll look at the good parts of your life as much as we look at the dark parts, the confusion, and possible misconceptions.\u201d \u201cIs it fun for you to do this work?\u201d \u201cI enjoy working on our relationship together. When we share the pain, I can bear it because I know that we\u2019re both growing. A successful psychotherapy session has learning opportunities for both of us. I look for what you have to teach me so that I will become a better person. Sometimes you may bring me a problem that I\u2019m working on myself. Our dialogue together will be of help. Sometimes I have to listen carefully to what I say to you because it\u2019s something that I also need to do for myself.\u201d My new client-in-training sighed. \u201cThat seems like a lot of work to me. How can you do all of that all the time? Is it good for you to have so much to do?\u201d \u201cI believe that it\u2019s good for me to be kind and respectful of someone else, to see the energy within the universe through plants, animals and our conversations. Yes, sometimes it is stressful and tiring.\u201d \u201cIf I can learn to do all of that too, I know I will become a good therapist.\u201d \u201cAs an intern, you\u2019ll be watching my work carefully.

{"id": "defining_moments_18", "text": "that I never got to ask my mother before she died. I think I want to talk about her first. My introject from her is too small because she died when I was so young.\u201d \u201cWe can get started on that as soon as you want.\u201d 7 OH , PLEASE LET ME SLEEP I\u2019m having trouble functioning during the day time because I\u2019m not getting enough sleep at night.\u201d Stacy dragged her body into my office and lay down on the couch instead of sitting in her usual way. \u201cTell me what\u2019s happening during the night?\u201d I replied. \u201cWell, I stay up watching TV until way after my husband goes to bed because I\u2019m afraid that I will toss and turn.\u201d \u201cHow much sleep are you getting on average each night?\u201d \u201cI get about four hours for three to four nights. Then I\u2019m so exhausted I load tip with four cups of coffee and am jumpy, cross, and cranky during the day.\u201d \u201cDo you ever nap during the day time?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too anxious to fall asleep during the day because it was always light when I got sexually abused by my grandfather.\u201d Stacy turned her head away from embarrassment. \u201cI understand. Until you and I can work on that issue, you need to sleep after dark ... Recent research suggests that adults need eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep each night. Technology is keeping us up too late. Lack of sleep is cumulative. Therefore, if you\u2019re missing four hours of sleep a night, that would mean you are short twenty-eight hours of sleep by the end of the week or 120 hours by the end of the month. No wonder you feel exhausted!\u201d \u201cYikes! ... I had no idea.\u201d She sat up straight for a minute then, slumped again. \u201cTherefore, sleep is a very important part of a healthy existence.\u201d \u201cI know ... but, what can I do?\u201d \u201cThere are six things you can do that should be helpful. First, get yourself some inexpensive calcium with magnesium. Each one should contain 500 mg of calcium with magnesium and zinc. Calcium will help you to calm down, relax and sleep. It is best to take one fifteen minutes before you go to bed. Health food stores, such as Trader Joe\u2019s, will carry them.\u201d \u201cIs that why people were told to drink warm milk before they go to bed?\u201d \u201cYes, but these capsules will give you much more calcium than one glass of warm milk. \u201cSecond, you can also take some melatonin. It\u2019s the natural substance released by the brain to help you go to sleep. It has no side effects for most people and is not addictive.\u201d \u201cIs that what pilots use to go in and out of different time zones.\u201d \u201cExactly ... and it will help you shift your circadian rhythm to be more like your husband\u2019s. Third, you can also shift your circadian rhythm slowly by going to bed ten minutes earlier each night. After you have done"}
{"id": "defining_moments_19", "text": "this for a week, you will be going to bed an hour earlier.\u201d \u201cGood. My husband is disappointed that we do not go to bed at the same time.\u201d She smiled for the first time and winked at me. \u201cYes, it must be hard on your sexual relationship. Finally, it\u2019s very important to understand that the universe is created for all creatures and plants to rest at night. Flowers fold up, birds stop singing and animals sleep. It\u2019s a time for us to rest, not to worry, not to resolve problems, not to work, or venture too far into the virtual world.\u201d Stacy had now gotten out a pad of paper and was jotting down each step. I persisted, \u201cOnce you get into bed, the fourth action you can take is to read a good book until your eyes feel tired. Then, the fifth action is to give yourself ten minutes each night when you turn off the light to think about all of the things for which you are thankful. Don\u2019t forget the basics, such as your health, food, shelter, hot water, and significant relationships, pets and friends. Then focus on the smaller things that were said to you, the flowers you saw, birds flying overhead, anything you learned or that happened that made the day worthwhile. Especially honor any creativity that you saw or created yourself. Notice the kindness and compassion that occurred to you or around you. You will naturally become peaceful and you will fall asleep. When you learn to do this every night, you will notice more nature and interactions during the daytime to recall at night. Do not forget that night is not a time to worry or think about problems.\u201d I continued. \u201cThe sixth step is very important. If you do not fall asleep within ten minutes, avoid at all costs getting anxious, tossing and turning. Instead, decide what you will get up to do if you do not fall asleep within the next ten minutes. Make it a chore that you like to avoid, such as paying the bills or washing the kitchen floor. You\u2019ll likely choose to sleep. Then go deeper into what was positive about your day. If you do not fall off to sleep, get up and do the chore. Go back to bed when you are tired.\u201d \u201cI never thought of any of those things.\u201d \u201cWell, I can assure you that they will be helpful to you. They\u2019re all actions that are good for you. You can use them for the rest of your life ... and none of them are addictive.\u201d \u201cDo you ever have trouble falling asleep?\u201d \u201cNot when I follow the steps I have just given you. I use them every night.\u201d \u201cCool ... Thank you so much. I\u2019ll stop and get the calcium capsules on the way home.\u201d 8 DON'T PUT YOUR BEST FRIENDS TO SLEEP One-half hour into my first meeting with Randy, I looked again at the initial evaluation questionnaire Randy had"}
{"id": "defining_moments_20", "text": "filled out, and continued on with my next question, \u201cDo you take any drugs?\u201d Randy answered defensively. \u201cI\u2019m not a drug addict if that\u2019s what you want to know.\u201d I persisted, \u201cI don\u2019t think you exactly answered my question.\u201d \u201cWell, artists use drugs to generate creativity. You already know that I\u2019m a musician.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re very lucky to have inherited some artistic genes. What drugs do you use to generate your creativity?\u201d \u201cMarijuana mostly. Sometimes I top it all off with some hard liquor.\u201d \u201cHow often and how much?\u201d \u201cNo problem, a couple of joints during the morning, sometimes the afternoon when I need a break, and always in the evening,\u201d Randy said nonchalantly. \u201cDoes anyone in your family have a problem with addiction?\u201d \u201cYeah, my Dad and my Granddad both used to drink too much.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think would happen if you decided to stop smoking marijuana?\u201d \u201cMy creativity would dry up. I wouldn\u2019t write music, I\u2019d stop getting gigs, and I\u2019d have to get a regular stupid job. That would be definitely uncool.\u201d Randy\u2019s detached demeanor seemed to be fading. \u201cHow has your musical career been going these days?\u201d \u201cNot so good for the past nine months.\u201d Randy shifted uneasily in his chair. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I came to talk with you ... I really miss it\u201d \u201cHow long have you been using pot?\u201d I persisted \u201cRegular use? Probably about a year or maybe two years, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cDo you think there could be any relationship between your drug use and your not doing so well in your career?\u201d \u201cNo relationship at all,\u201d Randy responded confidently. \u201cMarijuana helps me to be creative, as I\u2019ve already told you. It\u2019s not a hard street drug, you know what I mean.\u201d \u201cHow do you feel about your career not going so well?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know ... not that good ... I guess.\u201d \u201cSince you\u2019ve come to consult me about your career, let me tell you something that may surprise you ... You\u2019re an artist. Artists present negative and positive thoughts about the world for the rest of us to understand. Right?\u201d \u201cI guess you could look at it that way. Yeah ... Right!\u201d \u201cBut in order to do that, an artist has to have access to both negative and positive feelings. I\u2018d guess that you have written songs that are both sad and happy.\u201d \u201cYup.\u201d I moved forward from my relaxed position to sit on the edge of my chair. \u201cI can see one big problem. You think that marijuana and alcohol bring out your creativity. I think using any kind of drug, marijuana or alcohol, and any other hard drug actually anesthetizes your negative feelings and tricks you into thinking that you feel good and creative. But in reality, you\u2019re putting to sleep the very feelings you need to guide you to be an artist.\u201d \u201cWho the hell wants to feel bad? Then you can\u2019t do nothin.\u2019 Besides it\u2019s not cool for guys to show pain. That"}
{"id": "defining_moments_21", "text": "means you\u2019re doing badly.\u201d Randy got up and began to pace the room. \u201cFeeling bad or understanding any negative emotion is an important signal that something is going wrong in your life and that a change needs to be made. However, taking drugs makes you feel like nothing is wrong and that no change needs to be made. Drugs give you a dangerously false sense of security.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not my experience. Besides all artists use drugs. Maybe you don\u2019t know because you\u2019re probably not an artist. You\u2019re just a shrink.\u201d He stopped his pacing to glare at me. After some thought I revealed, \u201cActually I am an artist, but not a musician like you. I\u2019m a published writer, and I draw, sculpt and sing choral music.\u201d I persisted, trying a new approach. \u201cLet\u2019s look at this issue another way. Would you ever get on an airplane that is flying from Los Angeles to New York if you were told that the pilot had taken a black cloth and draped it over half of the dials on the left-hand side of the cockpit? Each left-hand dial records the presence and degree of each negative emotion. The black cloth would mean that the pilot couldn\u2019t see if any of the needles on the dials were moving upward toward the red zone. He could only see the dials on the right side of the cockpit representing all of the positive feelings. He could probably fly the plane all right for a time, but if his plane began to malfunction, it eventually would crash. Would you put gas, luggage, or yourself on a plane with a pilot who did that?\u201d \u201cNo. What kind of question is that?\u201d Randy paused, stopped in his tracks. \u201cWho would do a such a stupid thing?\u201d He sounded impatient. \u201cWell that\u2019s what a drug addict does. The drug makes it impossible for him to feel and understand his negative feelings. Therefore, he\u2019s not able to make the necessary daily corrections for his life to run smoothly. He begins to lose career opportunities and crises begin happening. Everyone has times of pain when life is not going well ... An addict is someone who can\u2019t manage pain.\u201d \u201cSo I suppose you\u2019re trying to say that my artist\u2019s career is not going so well because I\u2019m using pot? Lots of my artist friends use, and they seem to be doing just fine, thank you.\u201d \u201cMaybe for now, but not likely in the long run. Your negative feelings are your best friends. You need to sense them; use them to guide you and never be afraid of what they have to say. They\u2019re usually right on. No one else has the right to judge them because they are private and a necessary and normal part of life. Could we say that your negative feelings about your career brought you here to talk with me today?\u201d Randy said nothing, so I tried a different angle. \u201cDid you know that the most severe physical"}
{"id": "defining_moments_22", "text": "illness is the very rare patient who does not feel any physical pain? They usually die at a young age because they do not know when they are ill or what\u2019s wrong, so they cannot take any corrective action.\u201d \u201cOh God ... I can\u2019t tell if my negative feelings right now are telling me you are full of shit, or maybe you\u2019re right on and you\u2019ve made me feel uncomfortable.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to know the difference, isn\u2019t it? Are your feelings hard to reach because you smoked some marijuana this morning before you came here?\u201d \u201cWell ... ah ... maybe.\u201d My tone and manner stayed very supportive. \u201cA person who takes drugs acts like that pilot, but usually doesn\u2019t know it unless someone like me explains it to him.\u201d \u201cI get your drift,\u201d Randy conceded reluctantly. \u201cWell, let\u2019s take it just one more step for today. You seem to be saying that you honestly thought that your drug use was fostering your creativity. I suspect that the drugs you\u2019ve taken have hampered your creativity by taking away your negative feelings. I also think that you may have inherited your father and grandfather\u2019s addiction genes. That means that any drug you take will feel ten times better to you than to someone who does not have addiction genes, like me. Therefore, it\u2019s a lot harder for you not to use drugs than it is for me. It would take discipline. We can talk more about that later if you decide to return.\u201d \u201cAll my friends smoke. Do they all have addiction genes? What would I do for a social life?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how many of your friends have addiction genes or are blocking their negative feelings. You\u2019ll have to think that through carefully.\u201d He was pacing his way towards the window overlooking the lake. He wheeled around, \"Are you calling me a drug addict?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question we would need to consider if you decided to do some further work with me. If you have been smoking up to three times a day, I will just say at this point, that you may be needing to put to sleep a lot of negative feelings. An addict is usually someone who has the addiction gene and more psychological pain than they feel they can handle on their own. It would be my job to help you to find out what those feelings are so that you could use them instead to guide you. You could also go to a Twelve-Step AA Program, learn more, and find some new friends there who do not use any drugs.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll give you an example of what we\u2019ve been talking about from my own life. It happened just last weekend. I was sleeping in a hotel. The fire alarm went off at midnight all over the building. Everyone had to come down into the lobby. There were newlyweds, families with infants and children, old ladies, doddering granddads, and everyone else. We all had"}
{"id": "defining_moments_23", "text": "to wait until the problem was diagnosed and the alarm had been shut off. It took almost two hours. The problem was a bunch of kids smoking pot in room 315. Their smoke set off the smoke alarm system. With negative feelings asleep, they thought they were cool and could stop the alarm by pulling the smoke detector out of the ceiling. Their poor judgment set off all of the alarms throughout the entire hotel and inconvenienced hundreds of people. I suspect the teenagers may be in really big trouble. They were standing in the hallway with not a clue as to what they had done or what to do next.\u201d \u201cNot cool, you bet!\u201d Randy said uneasily. I looked at the clock and began to conclude Randy\u2019s first session. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to decide if you would like to talk with me further. I would feel uncomfortable taking your fee unless you decide to gradually reduce your drug use and then stop altogether. If you put any feelings to sleep, you will not be able to tell yourself or me about them\u2014a waste of your money, I\u2019d suspect. Think about it and let me know. If you decide not to return to talk with me further, there is no charge for this initial evaluation visit. It\u2019s a gift to you. I hope that it\u2019s useful, if not now, sometime in the future.\u201d \u201cThank you for your time. I\u2019ll have to think about all of this stuff I\u2019ve never heard before,\u201d said Randy, looking thoughtful and a little dazed. \u201cYou do that, and let me know what you decide. I will be here to help you. Translate all of your feelings about this meeting; and, I promise you, they will guide you as to what you should do with me and your career as a musician. Goodbye for now.\u201d \u201cI think I will be coming back to see you. I\u2019ll have to check with my parents first to see if they can help me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you again, if you decide to return.\u201d 9 I HATE MY FEELINGS ... THEY MAKE ME LOSE IT \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear what I have to say today\u201d Sandy, the mother of a five year old Ashley, stared at the carpet, refusing to look at me. \u201cWhy would that be?\u201d I encouraged at the beginning of her therapy hour. \u201cBecause ... I was a bad mother last night.\u201d \u201cDo you want to share with me what happened?\u201d Sandy shifted position uneasily. \u201cNo, it makes me hate myself, but I\u2019ll tell you. I guess you could say I \u2018lost it.\u2019 Ashley wouldn\u2019t settle down last night and go to sleep. She kept bouncing out of bed after I\u2019d tucked her in. I was patient for the first three times, but then something just took over me and I wasn\u2019t myself I pushed her down on the bed too hard and spanked her three times on her pajama bottom. Then, I got"}
{"id": "defining_moments_24", "text": "up and slammed the door too hard and ... to top it all off, I threw a dish in the kitchen so hard it broke! My husband woke up and was scared of me and mad.\u201d \u201cIt sounds like you were really patient for a long time before you lost control? Do you think you hit her hard enough to bruise her?\u201d \u201cOh no, I wouldn\u2019t do that. It was just a slap, but I never want to hit a kid. I was ... so tired. I didn\u2019t have much sleep this week because I had to stay up late to finish a project for work.\u201d \u201cParenting is the hardest job on the planet, isn\u2019t it? No one has done it perfectly yet. Sometimes it\u2019s more than we can handle.\u201d \u201cWell, I realized I\u2019d done wrong so I went right back to my kid and told her, \u2019Moms get mad sometimes, it\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m really sorry. I did wrong to spank you. I hope I didn\u2019t hurt you. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u201cWow, you did a rapid and excellent job with that response! What did she do?\u201d \u201cShe rubbed my arm softly and then went to sleep quickly.\u201d \u201cSounds like she understood.\u201d \u201cYeah, but I still feel terrible. I told her it won\u2019t happen again, but I can\u2019t promise that. What can I do so I don\u2019t spank her? I don\u2019t believe in physical punishment. That\u2019s my question.\u201d \u201cThere are four actions that you can do in the future. The first is always to trust your negative feelings because they\u2019re yelling loudly that something important is wrong. In that way, they are your best friends. Have a conversation within yourself, by yourself, reading your feelings any way you want. You can have a fantasy about what you might want to do, even an ugly one. Fantasies are free and private; they don\u2019t hurt anybody.\u201d \u201cI felt like I was capable of doing anything bad just to make her be perfectly still.\u201d \u201cSee, you\u2019re already owning your fantasy and learning how badly you needed your daughter to cooperate. Good for you.\u201d Now you can move on to the second action. Once you figure out what you feel, then try to translate your emotions into reasonable constructive language that\u2019s honest and clear. A negative feeling may direct you to ask someone for help, or set limits, or say \u2018no\u2019 to a request. If it takes a while to figure out what you\u2019re thinking, it\u2019s always all right to ask for a time-out for yourself. Get away from the source of your frustration until you regain control.\u201d \u201cIt was strange, because the feeling was so strong that it almost took over me.\u201d Sandy was sitting up straight and looking at me directly, very intently. \u201cWhen it feels that strong, there\u2019s a very important question to ask yourself.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sandy looked like she could hardly wait for my answer. \u201cWe\u2019re now looking at the third action you can take. You have"}
{"id": "defining_moments_25", "text": "to ask yourself, \u2018Does this moment remind me of anything that has happened to me before that also made me unhappy or angry?\u2019 \u201d \u201cOhhhhh ... now I\u2019m beginning to get it ... It did remind me of something that happened before! When I was a kid, I used to be afraid to fall asleep at night, just like my daughter, because ... wow! ... My parents would take drugs and have fights. Oh my God! ... They\u2019d break dishes, just like I did! Whoa! ... Back then, I was afraid one of them would be dead or injured in the morning. I wanted to stay up to protect them, but I also hated them for fighting ... just like I hated my dear daughter for a minute, when I really love her so much.\u201d \u201cOnce again ... Good for you to be able to reach back into your life story and discover those feelings. No wonder you spanked her!\u201d \u201cYikes!\u201d \u201cPerhaps you decided to hide your own feelings as a child so they would not make your parents more upset? Perhaps they\u2019ve been stored inside you all this time.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it! So much anger just came crashing out of me last night.\u201d \u201cThen, lets go back to action two and look at what you need to say, in constructive language, to your husband and your daughter.\u201d \u201cI guess I need to tell my husband what happened in the past. I could tell him that it would help if he could give me a hug instead of being scared and angry I could tell my daughter that I need to be able to sleep at night so that I can be a patient Mom all day. She can help me by staying in bed. Maybe I need to be firmer with her about that.\u201d Sandy looked relieved and thoughtful. \u201cNow you\u2019re understanding your feelings clearly. You can take action on them constructively. I believe your husband and daughter will understand. Your feelings are there to guide you, not to make you feel crazy. Now you\u2019ll have a better idea as to what to do with them in the future.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going to report me to the Department of Child and Family Services?\u201d \u201cNo, there\u2019s no need for me to do that. First of all, I know you to be a good and loving parent. You did not physically injure your daughter, and you made amends to her right away to repair any psychological damage. Then you took the fourth action we can take when we \u2018lose it.\u2019 You came to talk with someone, in this case me, about what happened in a responsible way, to understand your feelings, so it\u2019s less likely to happen again. You may want to talk with me further about your parents\u2019 substance abuse and fights whenever you wish to release more of those piled up feelings in small manageable pieces.\u201d \u201cI get it ... I feel better now. I was afraid to come and"}

Therefore, it is a gift and a blessing from the unconscious, sent in a way that cannot be ignored, at just the right time. The first anxiety attack feels nothing but scary and can manifest itself in many different ways. When I was in graduate school, studying to be a psychotherapist, and in a training psychotherapy myself, I had an anxiety attack that suddenly threw me, literally, to the ground. I went immediately to the emergency room of the nearest hospital, fearing that something was seriously wrong with my brain. The doctor told me that I had experienced an anxiety attack, and suggested that I think about what was happening to me when it occurred. He did not give me anti-anxiety medication. I recognized that I had suddenly fallen as soon as I heard two words spoken by a friend. These two words described a trauma that had happened to me in early childhood, but I had no conscious memory of it. My anxiety attack was the harbinger of a detailed piece of work I still needed to do to recapture and understand what had happened to me, and how this trauma influenced my responses in the present. It was, indeed, a defining moment of great significance. Anxiety attacks can be mild or severe. Some are just a vague sense of disequilibrium or dizziness. Other attacks, with heart palpitations, make my clients fear that they\u2019re having a heart attack. Most clients are afraid they\u2019re going to die. These fears escalate the anxiety making the attack more severe. Emergency care and primary care physicians tend to prescribe Xanax, Valium, or Klonopin which are addictive anti-anxiety drugs, instead of telling their clients to make an appointment with a psychotherapist. Therefore, the client may become dependent upon these highly addictive medications. Anxiety attacks not treated with psychotherapy will tend to continue unabated, leaving the clients feeling increasingly afraid, causing them to withdraw more from the world around them. I saw two clients recently who were very afraid of the anxiety attacks they were experiencing until they were referred to me. Both clients were in love with someone. The relationship was becoming deeper and more important to them. Both of them had divorce experiences in childhood and messages from parents that made them afraid to continue further with their present intimate relationships. They were stuck between the fear of continuing the relationship and the sorrow of losing it. The anxiety attack about divorce helped them to ferret out the reasons they were afraid. We came to understand the details and memories together. Then they could continue the current relationship without any anxiety attacks. I have the greatest respect for the unconscious. Its memory is phenomenal, its knowledge superb, and its timing exquisite. That\u2019s why, as a therapist, I endeavor only to walk along beside my"}
{"id": "defining_moments_27", "text": "clients without pushing or pulling, because the unconscious is much wiser than both the client and I can ever be together. Its \u201cattack\u201d is sent as a gift at the right moment to free each client from past misconceptions so that they may go on with life as a whole integrated person. As soon as the psychotherapist and client can understand the message being sent by the anxiety attack, the attack then ceases completely because the central issue is addressed and understood. 11 INTEGRATING LOST PARTS OF SELF It is not unusual for me to meet and come to understand two parts of a client. The first is the adult presenting the unique life story. The second part emerges later in our dialogue together when the working alliance is strong enough to receive it. It\u2019s usually a much younger version of the client. This part has gone into hiding because the child has protected herself by escaping some abuse that happened in the past, and/or blames herself for something that went wrong. Initially, the client may be unaware that this more concealed part exists. We all know what it is like to get into an argument with a loved one, and behave in an unacceptable manner that appears to \u201ccome out of nowhere.\u201d Everyone looks puzzled with raised eyebrows, wondering \u201cWhat just happened to you?\u201d However, it\u2019s often the child part of the client, making an unexpected appearance with some important intense feelings that first occurred earlier during childhood. This child\u2019s wisdom is suddenly available to help us with the work at hand. Couples come in for an appointment to report a marital argument. After taking a good history of each person\u2019s childhood, we can take it apart, looking at what the adult part of each spouse felt. Then we look at the central issue as expressed through the child part of each spouse. This often allows us to understand and respect feelings in a way that the couple never could before. The child\u2019s wisdom is often enormously clarifying, explaining clearly the behavior and the feelings underneath. We can see and appreciate the pain; and, at the same time, even come to have a sense of humor about the uncomfortable interactions that happened. The couple learns to speak and share the dual language of the adult and the child. That is intimacy. The child shares important pieces of wisdom acquired before psychological defenses came into play to blur painful truth. Next, the adult part of the client begins to talk, to embrace, and protect the child part. As a consequence, childhood misconceptions become erased, leaving instead depth of understanding and feelings. Creative energies become stronger as an integration takes place between the child and the adult parts of the client. Only then can the client take on the full responsibility of maintaining self-esteem. Within the relationship from the therapist to the client, I provide genuine clarification, reflection, validation, interpretation and encouragement which are all freely given. A strong foundation is"}
{"id": "defining_moments_28", "text": "being constructed by the therapist and the expanding introject of the therapist to hold together the newly-integrated self of the client. During one psychotherapy session, a client who had been sexually abused, brought in a journal of the conversations between the adult and child parts of herself. She shared some dialogues so we could see one of many unique ways that the process of integration can happen. Sometimes these dialogues took place within her imaginary larger visual picture. Adult part to child: \u201cPlease understand that I'm really working on being able to take you back, to love you, to thank you, to cherish you, to trust you, and to let you guide me with your child wisdom, and to let you be with me for the rest of my life. Then I can do better with my family, friendships, and clients.\u201d Child to adult: \u201cI want you to know that I do know you and everything you have done. You are the only one who has to be introduced to me. After all, I\u2019ve been locked up inside of you all these years. I knew you when you didn\u2019t know me. \u201d Child to adult: \u201cYou have been working really hard at this, and I\u2019m proud of you. Remember, you can\u2019t push me forward. I will just come on my own, in consultation with your trusty unconscious and your competent therapist. It\u2019s not all your responsibility, so don\u2019t feel so accountable.\u201d Child to adult: \u201cLook, I took the core of yourself away to save it. I took away the heart of your soul. So you don\u2019t have a self to love. I\u2019ve held onto it, but I\u2019ve been so battered I can hardly see it myself. You will only be able to have self-love when you integrate me back into your life. Even then, it will be a damaged version. I\u2019m the only one who can see me, your soul and you together. Obviously, I like you better than you do. I see some hope of having a conscious place in your life some day. I just can\u2019t wait!\u201d Child to adult: \u201cHow do you think I feel having to go away from you all of these years? I didn\u2019t do anything that bad. You think you missed out on being with me! I missed everything, events, being known and respected, and validated. You didn\u2019t even know when I guided you. You can\u2019t decide what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m carrying a bomb so don\u2019t mess with me too much or you\u2019ll be in big trouble. I hate this whole mess, I hate the damage that has to be revealed. I hate the secrets I hold. I hate that your parents will never be able to validate what happened, and that I hold the sole responsibility of convincing you . . . I may be wise, but I\u2019m just a child. I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d Child to adult: \u201cWell, you had better get used to me, because"}
{"id": "defining_moments_29", "text": "I'm here to stay. You\u2019ve gone too far in making contact with me to get away with ever getting rid of me. . . Yeah. . .\u201d Adult to child: When I didn\u2019t understand, I presented myself in a confusing manner. My child responded with confusion. So there have been many years with confusion. That\u2019s what has driven the creativity.\u201d Child to adult: \u201cSoo, perhaps there\u2019s a chance that you\u2019re really going to be able to protect me some more. You\u2019re going to be able to give me love, kindness, and safety within your competent mastery. Maybe I won\u2019t have to hide much any more. This kind of conversation provides richness inside. Visual picture of integration: \u201cThe little girl is now a fully grown, replica of me. One day she came toward me out of the waves on the beach. When I reached out to take her hands she was gone. I thought she was bringing me more memories; but no, she appeared to be merging with me to share and survive the despair I\u2019d felt. The little girl is integrated now so that I cannot separate her back out. I miss her because I can no longer speak to this separate piece of strength. \u201d Visual picture of integration: \u201cI was in a forest. I saw myself as if in the shadows of the trees, gray, and transparent. I could almost see through me. I stepped out into the sunshine and saw myself for the first time as the person that I really am. The shadowy person is what I felt as a child. I felt able to tackle my generalized anxiety for the first time because there was a person there of substance whom I could trust to take care of me. I had never felt this integrated presence of the child and adult before, although I somehow knew that she existed. \u201d The resulting integration is, as anyone can see, worth its weight in gold. 12 FIGHTING DEPRESSION THE NATURAL WAY Tom sat down for his first hour after his initial evaluation. I asked him, \u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d Tom responded slowly, \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I know that we met last week and I\u2019m beginning to understand some of the feelings I\u2019ve had for a really long time. I also feel that it will take quite a few hours for us to settle my particular issues. In the meantime, I do feel mildly depressed some of the time. I don\u2019t want to take any medication. I can\u2019t afford it because I don\u2019t have insurance, and I can\u2019t handle the frequent side-effect of weight gain. What can I do to feel less depressed while we\u2019re doing this work? I used to drink alcohol, but I don\u2019t want to do that any more either.\u201d \u201cGood for you. Your question is important. There are several actions that I can suggest.\u201d \u201cGood, because I need them,\u201d he sighed. \u201cThe first action you can take is to get a half"}

If you do not have a sport, find a pleasant area where there is nature near where you live to take a walk. See if you can briskly walk a mile per day.\u201d Tom perked up. \u201cI suppose I could walk near the river, or the park.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re getting the idea. When you walk, do not think about the events that make you depressed. Instead, take long., slow breaths and concentrate on noticing everything you can about the nature around you. Notice the wind in the trees as a model of how to breathe.\u201d \u201cAre you talking about a walking meditation?\u201d \u201cYes, I walk on the Los Angeles River for thirty minutes every day with four dogs. I\u2019ve been walking dogs for thirty five years. It adds up to lots of discipline that\u2019s good for my overall health. My walk burns two hundred calories a day, and adds up to two hundred and fifty miles a year, for a total of around nine thousand miles over many years. I count the ducks, mallards, herons, geese, cormorants, stiffs and egrets. I watch the baby mallards with their mom, the sixty pigeons swoop and swarm in a graceful dance around the bridge, and the black ravens \u201ccaw\u201d to me from the tops of trees. I notice the details of the inside of the wild flowers, watch the hummingbirds feed, and listen to the birds sing. Obsessive, depressed and worried thoughts are chased away by the beauty and magic of the universe. Out of my quieted mind sometimes surfaces a creative idea or an insight without effort.\u201d \u201cDo you do it because you get depressed?\u201d \u201cPerhaps I would be if I didn\u2019t. I take in a lot of psychic pain from the work I do each day. I need some way to settle it in my mind, and let it go. Walking, gardening, writing, and singing with choral groups help me to turn the pain from all of my clients into useful ideas and productive action.\u201d \u201cCool.\u201d \u201cWhen you come up with an idea or insight while exercising, don\u2019t talk yourself out of it later. Always stay with the thoughts you had while exercising. When you feel depressed, and want to go to bed, make yourself get up and do something active instead. We have been designed by the universe to move; the more we move the better we feel. Exercise is good for emotional health, increasing neurotransmitters that elevate mood. Exercise reduces stress, oxygenates the brain, relieves muscle tension, and provides a release for pent up anger, irritation and frustration.\u201d \u201cI think I can make exercise work. I\u2019ll have to get up an hour earlier in the morning.\u201d \u201cI get up at six. After my walk with the dogs, I do another half hour of"}

A restless therapist is of concern to clients.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else I can do?\u201d Tom persisted. \u201cYes, I remember that you\u2019re living alone at this time.\u201d \u201cYup, I get depressed when I have too much time alone.\u201d \u201cHave you thought about getting a pet?\u201d \u201cYes, but the landlord doesn\u2019t want me to have a dog or a cat.\u201d \u201cYeah, I remember those days. Would you like to have a parakeet? They chirp a beautiful song when you turn on the water, and you can teach them to speak, sit on your shoulder and your finger.\u201d \u201cWow, that might work! Then I would have someone to talk with me.\u201d Tom brightened. \u201cPrecisely ... You could also ask a neighbor who might work a long day, if you could take his dog for a walk with you each day. The dog and the owner would probably be delighted. You could have the companionship with the dog and earn a little extra money to pay for your therapy.\u201d \u201cAwesome ... and the bird would not be very expensive.\u201d \u201cThere are also a number of foods that contribute mightily to lifting depression. Try fish oil, beans, dark chocolate, saffron, turmeric, walnuts, ginger and sunflower seeds.\" \u201cI can do that. I love ginger and walnuts.\u201d \u201cRight ... Our talking together each week, and those three ideas should help a lot with your depression. If for any reason, it still persists, then we could look into a consultation with a psychiatrist. But let\u2019s try these options first.\u201d \u201cYou bet I will ... I already feel less depressed.\u201d \u201cYou were able to read your discouraged feeling about depression and bring it to me so that we could talk about it and take constructive action. Taking action does a lot to take care of depression.\u201d \u201cNow I\u2019m ready to talk about my relationship with my girlfriend.\u201d 13 I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS AN ADULT CHILD OF AN ALCOHOLIC (ACA) Two clients came in my office to consult with me in back-to-back hours. Both were adult children of alcoholics (ACA) clients. They did not understand the role alcohol played within their families. They saw themselves simply as available to meet others\u2019 needs. They are \u201cgivers\u201d to an extreme; they\u2019ve often hitched up with \u201ctakers\u201d who intuitively knew that these two clients would meet their needs. The first client came in after the Christmas holiday truly bewildered. She had \u201cmissed Christmas.\u201d She was living with a family from a Middle Eastern culture who did not celebrate this holiday. She had arranged the week before to go to a Christmas evening church service. Her family had offered to do anything she wanted one day last week, but she did not realize that it was Christmas. By the time she looked at her calendar,"}
{"id": "defining_moments_32", "text": "Christmas had passed unnoticed. She had not decorated a tree or bought any gifts. The second client was feeling \u201cweird and depressed.\u201d It was his birthday. Last year he had not mentioned it to anyone, so nothing happened for his birthday. He had gone on a hike and felt terribly alone. This year he\u2019d told someone at work what had happened last year. They had responded with an elaborate party which made him feel terrible in a different way because he did not know how to handle it. There was something in common about these two clients. Both of them were truly afraid to express to anyone what they really needed. How does that happen? I explained to both clients that it takes some time in therapy for an adult child of an alcoholic (ACA) client to understand that they learned at a very young age to give up childhood and step into a care-taking role for their alcoholic parent. They put aside their own feelings, especially any feeling that might upset the alcoholic parent, in an attempt to keep the parent from drinking. Children intuitively know that their parents\u2019 judgment is impaired because of the substance abuse addiction. They know that their home and their very existence may be severely threatened at any time, especially when the parent is driving. They try to keep their parents on their feet so that the child will have a home with caretaking. These two clients helped me to understand even more. They told me: \u201cIt feels really dangerous for me to ask for what I need.\u201d \u201cI really can anticipate what others need. If I suggest it before they realize it themselves, they will reject my offer, only to come back and take it later.\u201d \u201cI get my self-esteem needs met entirely by helping others in an exquisite way and having them acknowledge me for what I have done. I have to go on doing that.\u201d \u201cI can meet other\u2019s needs for a really long time. I\u2019m doing just fine. But then I suddenly find myself depressed. I stay that way for a while. Then I\u2019m not interested in what anyone else wants. Somebody asks for something and, all of a sudden, I\u2019m mad ... I mean really mad. I\u2019m impossible to deal with. I can\u2019t help myself. I\u2019m beginning to finally understand why. I guess it\u2019s because everyone else is taking me for granted and no one is ever meeting my needs ... I suppose it\u2019s the very feeling I must have had so many times with my drunk mother.\u201d \u201cIt seems so strange and uncomfortable to put my needs out there. I would rather forget what I want.\u201d \u201cAre you absolutely sure that I won\u2019t get into big trouble if I take care of me, too?\u201d As we work through this pain together, clients are able to try putting out their needs a little bit at a time. They call between hours when they need help and find out that"}
{"id": "defining_moments_33", "text": "I\u2019m not angry with them and that we still have a relationship. They discover that nothing bad happens. They even begin to have some fun going out into the world to have the kind of goofy fun that belongs with children and the childhood they\u2019ve lost. They learn that it\u2019s appropriate to ask for something that\u2019s part way between not mentioning a birthday and coping with a huge party. Instead, they learn to ask for dinner with a friend, lover, or a trip to the store to buy a reasonable present. I always love the hours in which an Adult Child of an Alcoholic really \u201cgets it.\u201d Then they say, \u201cThank you for explaining it to me so that I could understand. I can now change my behavior in a way that really works and is also fine for others.\u201d They\u2019ve learned that friends want not only to be helped, but want to be invited to give back to each and every one of my clients. Adult Children of Alcoholics give all of us exceptional care. They fill some of the ranks of our teachers, doctors, and mental health professionals. We have to recognize them, never take them for granted, and help them to attend to their own needs as well as they serve others. Otherwise they may \u201ccrash and burn,\u201d which would be a tragic result after all the care and concern they have given their alcoholic parents and to all of us. 14 THE MORE YOU HELP YOURSELF, THE MORE HELP YOU WILL GET Alice looked pale and completely worn out. \u201cMy husband is still in the process of leaving me. He doesn\u2019t see that I\u2019m really upset. He didn\u2019t notice that I took too many pills even though he is a dentist. I went to the hospital emergency room to check myself in to the psych ward because I felt so bad, because he wouldn\u2019t even drive me there. I don\u2019t think he cares if I die. I still love him. I go back and forth between being loving and screaming at him that I\u2019m in really bad shape. Everything I do seems to drive him farther and farther away. We were in love; how can he be so heartless? I don\u2019t know what else to do. I feel so hopeless; suicide seems like the only thing left to do. My whole married life has been for him and he doesn\u2019t even care.\u201d \u201cI can understand that you\u2019re very upset and that this is an extremely difficult time for you. When you\u2019re being rejected, it\u2019s really hard to remember that you\u2019re still a valuable person with your own strengths and talents.\u201d Alice spoke with certainty. \u201cWell, all I know is that I must have done something terribly wrong.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not a foregone conclusion we can make at this time. However, sometimes we learn something new as a result of facing hard times squarely.\u201d \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d \u201cWell ... let\u2019s take a look. Apparently, you\u2019re telling him"}

What could you do to help yourself?\u201d \u201cWell ... I think I need to find a new place to live because living with him when he doesn\u2019t love me anymore is hell.\u201d \u201cGood thought.\u201d Alice sat up a little more and looked at me for the first time, \u201cA friend mentioned that she has a neighbor who is renting a room in her condo because her husband died. She has a home instead of our tiny apartment, so I could bring my two cats with me. At least I would not have to separate from them too.\u201d \u201cMore good thinking ... and I wonder if your husband would be more responsive to you if you showed him how you were taking care of yourself.\u201d \u201cWhen I told him about this possible plan, he spoke to me nicely for the first time.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a principle here that might be of enormous help to you just now, especially when you feel suicidal. Sometimes we ask for help from others by letting them know just how much we\u2019ve been hurt. In a way, we try to go \u2018belly up.\u2019 We\u2019ve all tried it from time to time. I think you\u2019re already noticing that the more we can take care of ourselves, the more other people will step forward and give us a hand. When we go \u2018belly up,\u2019 others may get nervous and pull away; not sure what to do or if they can help. However, if we come up with a plan, take it as far as we can ourselves, then they\u2019re more likely to say, \u2018Sure, I can contribute something.\u2019 People like to be asked and like to help, but only when they can figure out what to do and feel as if it\u2019s going to be worth their time.\u201d \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right ... Three friends have offered to help me with a garage sale and to put some things in storage if I decide to move.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good example. Have you talked with the person who has the room to rent?\u201d \u201cNot yet. I fluctuate between wanting to stay in the apartment to piss my husband off, and just getting away from all of his rejection of me. I came here today to ask you what you thought.\u201d \u201cWhich one is taking care of you?\u201d \u201cI guess that leaving would be best for me.\u201d \u201cI agree because retaliation never really works.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s so much work to move. He should have to do it instead of me.\u201d \u201cI get it."}

Since I don\u2019t know what to do, maybe I\u2019m not worth much.\u201d \u201cI hear your confusion, but I also think that you\u2019re selling yourself short.\u201d \u201cOne of life\u2019s biggest ongoing challenges is holding up your self-esteem. We all struggle to believe in ourselves from time to time, and especially when we\u2019re in transition. Sometimes we think too much about what others may want us to do. Then we lose track of our own thoughts.\u201d \u201cYeah, especially when everyone we ask wants something different.\u201d \u201cWell ... let\u2019s take a look. Sometimes it\u2019s important to ask the question, \u2018What would I do if I didn\u2019t have to worry about anybody else?\u2019 It\u2019s only one of many critical questions, and answering it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re being selfish.\u201d Mary sat up straight on the edge of her chair. \u201cOh God, shall I really tell her?\u201d she whispered to herself. Then her face brightened for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s an easy one ... I would take a year away from school and get a job. I want to be on my own, pay my own bills, and decide what to do with my life. I\u2019d like to just take the four courses, this summer on line that I need to be able to work with preschool children. That job would also help me decide whether I want to be a teacher and have kids myself someday.\u201d \u201cSo you do have a plan for yourself, but you\u2019re afraid of disapproval from family and friends. Is that right?\u201d \u201cWell ... yeah ... since you put it that way.\u201d She slumped into the couch again. \u201cI think that you\u2019re on the right track for yourself. What Mom and Dad want you to do, might be right for them, but not necessarily for you\u201d \u201cYou got it!\u201d She looked at me intensely startled. \u201cWell, we humans are social beings; and, of course, we want approval and to be liked by others. But no one is really in the position to tell you what to do, because no one knows you as well as you do. There\u2019s never going to be, nor has there been, another person like you. Is that right?\u201d \u201cWell ... yes. I never thought of it that way.\u201d \u201cThe other problem is everyone is trying to hold up their own self-esteem by doing what they like to do best. It\u2019s a full-time job. Therefore, no one really has much time to look at your life, what you\u2019re doing, and validate it for you ...

Her eyes seemed to sparkle for the first time. \u201cIf you do what\u2019s best for you, you\u2019ll attract people who like to do the same kind of activities. Then you\u2019ll have the companionship of people around you who approve of what you do. You may ask their advice from time to time, but you remain the sole person to decide what\u2019s best for you.

You\u2019re the first person to hear it.\u201d \u201cGood for you. I have respect for what you\u2019ve decided. Your plan sounds sensible to me. Once you decide what to do, you have to evaluate how you\u2019re progressing all by yourself. My clients don\u2019t tell me how well I did with their psychotherapy hour, unless I did something wrong that made them mad or upset. Therefore, it becomes my responsibility to evaluate each hour myself\u201d \u201cNow I have to go home and tell my family what I think. I hope they won\u2019t be too disappointed.\u201d \u201cIf they\u2019re upset, that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re necessarily doing something wrong. Listen to what they have to say. Take it into consideration. We all have to disappoint others from time to time to do what\u2019s best for ourselves in the long run. Suppose you apply for a job, there are twenty applicants, and you get the job. You will have to disappoint nineteen people. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to turn down the job.\u201d \u201cYeah ... I get it.\u201d I could see the wheels turning in her brain. \u201cWe are really talking about finding your own true self. As you discover it, you will find it to be resilient to criticism, and not afraid of challenge. Your true self does not concern itself with superiority or inferiority It just knows what is right for you.\u201d \u201cAnd ... it takes a while to find it?\u201d \u201cYes, indeed ...

Now we can be \u201cplugged in\u201d all of the time, able to receive and send a message by cell phone, e- mail, web sites, texting, tweeting, blogging, looking up each other on Facebook, MySpace, and events on You Tube. We can find and make new contacts with former friends, adoptees can discover their birth parents, and employers can look up a candidate for a job interview and talk with their previous employers. With Facebook and MySpace we can see what\u2019s happening with our friends each day. We can advertise services and write articles for each other on web sites. We can get information about almost anything, including the news that can be downloaded onto our cell phone. What an advance! Clients are enjoying the advantages and also noting some of the down sides. Some teens are basing their popularity and self-esteem on how many contacts they can receive each day. They are texting during class, and keeping their cell phones on by their pillow late into the night so as not to miss any calls. As a result, their learning and sleep are both disrupted. Children are asking their parents to \u201cPleeease stop texting\u201d in the middle of a conversation they are trying to complete. They are tired of hearing, \u201cJust a minute, Dear.\u201d Some clients are forgetting to turn off a cell phone during a psychotherapy hour, and it disrupts our conversation in the middle of strong feelings about something important. Some keep it on because they can\u2019t wait to discover who is calling. Other clients are noticing that they are spending too much time on Facebook and MySpace checking in on what other people are doing, comparing their life with others, and hoping for a personal message of some kind from someone as validation to bolster self-esteem. Their self-worth is too much determined by how many \u201cfriends\u201d they have acquired and how"}
{"id": "defining_moments_39", "text": "often they communicate. Some get stuck repeatedly looking at what is happening with a former romantic partner instead of planning and executing the day in a way that would make them feel successful. Living too much in the virtual world keeps them restless, interrupting their own goals. Some clients find that the text message that just came in might be more important than the conversation they are having with someone else at the dinner table. Has solitude or time to reflect become a thing of the past? I walk my unleashed big dogs on the LA River each morning as my time to watch nature to see the incredible power of the universe. When people approach, they often cannot hear me say, \u201cGood Morning\u201d and \u201cThe dogs are friendly,\u201d because they are so plugged into the sound in their ears that they cannot hear my reassurance even when they are fearful of the dogs. I pass feeling disconnected. Many people have stopped reading books because their reading time has migrated into wandering in the virtual world. They have lost touch with the reality that reading can be a nourishing supportive personal contact with the experience and wisdom of an author. Some marriage partners are losing important sleep watching addictive porn, or conducting an internet affair late at night when their spouse is asleep. The legal guidelines to maintain confidentiality in psychology mandate that therapists do not conduct conversations with clients via the internet. Therefore, my clients and I still get to talk with each other by telephone and in person. I remember that e-mail and texting are only 2-5 percent of the total communication, while telephone is 17-22 percent and face- to-face contact is 100 percent. I feel exceptionally privileged to have many meaningful professional 100 percent dialogues each week. As a result of these concerns, my clients and I have come up with some suggestions to preserve the importance of this advanced technology and to keep it from running their lives in an unproductive way. 1. Make sure to have contact with friends by telephone, arranging for face-to-face visits. Save really important communications for face-to-face contact. Remember that intimacy is two hearts in reasonable physical proximity to each other. Have the courtesy to break up with someone in person, not by text. 2. When on Facebook, think about the people you would like to reach out to with a message rather than just looking for who might contact you. Then let go and see what happens. 3. Take disciplined responsibility for deciding how many times to \u201ccheck in\u201d per day. 4. Use the internet wisely for research purposes to learn what you need to know to make your life run smoothly. 5. When you have broken off a relationship, discipline yourself to limit the need to peer into the life of the ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend. Move on so that you will be available and have the space to meet someone new. 6. Turn off communication technology when having an"}
{"id": "defining_moments_40", "text": "important conversation with a loved one, child, or mentor, teacher, doctor or other important relationship. 7. Make sure there is time in the day when you are connected only with yourself, so that you have reflective time to decide how to conduct your own life. 8. Don\u2019t put too much of yourself on the internet. Remember that a potential new boss, lover, partner, college or graduate schools might be looking at who you are in the virtual world. 9. Don\u2019t cheat your employer by spending too much time socializing on the internet during work hours. 10. Limit your e-mails and texts to useful information. Don\u2019t be late meeting others because you can text them saying \u201cI\u2019m late.\u201d 11. Save time with a good spam detector and virus control. Be careful what you buy and how much you use your credit card on line. 12. Stay away from porn, especially if you are married. It\u2019s very addictive because the hormones released present a feeling of attachment to a virtual character. 13. Don\u2019t get too caught up in \u201cMuch ado about nothing.\u201d 14. Never text while driving. Pull over if a message is urgent. Otherwise enjoy these beautiful advances. In the final analysis, it is my hope that we will not lose our cultural and historical heritage by leaving behind only quick superficial bantering communications with each other through e-mail, Facebook and MySpace. Blogging may be an exception leaving a legacy to read over time equal to such important and informative writings as The Diary of Anne Frank. 17 FOUR KINDS OF WORKERS INTERACT; WHICH ARE YOU? In the work force, we seem to have four basic types of individuals. We can look at the descriptions of two of the types as representing two ends of a continuum. The first we shall call \u201cAltruistic Work Personality.\u201d These individuals appear dedicated to \u201cmaking a difference.\u201d They derive their ultimate satisfaction out of developing and using a natural talent or interest, and doing something lasting that may contribute to the lives of other people or the environment. Secondarily, they desire a sustainable income. These individuals traditionally are most often seen in the arts, academic world and service professions, and constitute much of our volunteer force. They view the world as an interdependent community and try to contribute what they can. They donate money and effort to worthy causes. They want their inner life to be rich, and are less concerned about external material possessions. If they acquire wealth, they tend to donate a sizable portion of it to others. These individuals are not easily drawn into conflict. They want to live peacefully and use their particular talent to provide a specific service. They are not attracted to large groups and often prefer to work alone or with a small groups of like-minded thinkers. They tend to be naive about the potential for others to be greedy and rip them off. The second work personality, we call \u201cMaterialistic Work Personality.\u201d This individual tends to be"}

They are able to use bureaucracy to their advantage \u2014 fast tracking to the top as a leader. They produce fantastic products that we can all use and enjoy. They are able to sell themselves well, and drive a hard bargain and close a deal. Conflict is often a positive challenge; competition attracts them. They have little concern for how others are affected while they are obtaining their goal. Ethics, and sharing are frequently compromised in the name of \u201cdoing business.\u201d Their goal is almost always \u201cto have a little more\u201d of whatever they are collecting, often without the realization that to obtain this hurts other people and doesn\u2019t make the Materialistic Work Personality happier. Materialistic work personality sometimes becomes carried away in reaching their goal, contributing to the imbalance or displacement of the line workers who serve them, their nation and/or the planet. Altruistic work personality takes too long to get concerned about Materialistic work personality behavior, but eventually steps in to try to \u201cmake a difference\u201d by attempting to acknowledge the underdog and restore balance. These two work personalities then butt heads often competing and devaluing each other. Materialistic work personality tactics often win because Altruistic work personality may feel intimidated and is unwilling to compromise their ethics; meanwhile, Materialistic work personality is much more comfortable with competing and winning at any cost. Materialistic work personality acquires enormous sums of money while Altruistic work personality struggles, too often, with the proceeds from grants, donations, contributions, fund raising, a bake or community rummage sale. Both Altruistic and Materialistic work personality individuals are needed to maintain society and each have advantages and disadvantages, strengths and vulnerabilities. How does a Altruistic and Materialistic work personality develop? How can we raise children to have the best qualities of these two work personalities, minimizing the vulnerabilities that might ultimately hurt society or the planet? It is said that the tallest buildings run the culture. In the eighteenth century, it was the churches. In the nineteenth century, it was the universities. More recently it is the corporate world. Unfortunately the philosophy of the Materialistic personality dominates by telling us all that it is somehow all right to put out addictive or defective products, treat corporate workers with blatant disregard, earn absurdly large bonuses, bailouts, lower taxes, golden parachutes, and intimidate each other with lobbyists, law suits and buyouts solely for the purpose of increasing profits. The movie, Insider, is a testament to the degree that such a philosophy can be carried out. When we behave this way, what kind of message do we give to our children? How can we expect our kids to be considerate, ethical and caring in the face of such blatant hurtful ways. We seem to be at a loss as to how"}

The third kind is the person who says, \u201cI want to make this amount of money in my pay check. I don\u2019t care what kind of job I do as long as I reliably get the money. Life, for me, begins after work. These kind of workers frequently do a somewhat repetitive job cheerfully and responsibly. After work, they do what they want with their free time utilizing sports, hobbies and parties. The fourth kind of worker is an artist. They want time to be creative with what ever form of art they practice. They are persistent in their creative endeavors, although they sometimes have to fight discouragement and frustration in gaining acceptance for their work. They need four hours a day to do their creative work. In the remaining time, they may also choose to have a more routine job that pays the food and rent and keeps them out in the world where they can interact with others for the purpose of generating further creativity. Artists have to work with Materialistic Work Personality in Hollywood\u2019s entertainment industry even when their styles of functioning and overall goals are so very different. Which kind of worker are you? How are you interacting with other kinds of workers? Are you presently the kind of work personality you want to be? If you are not, go directly to the essay entitled \u201cLife\u2019s Two Most Important and Privileged Questions\u201d for further help. 18 LIFE\u2019S TWO MOST IMPORTANT AND PRIVILEGED QUESTIONS My thirty-year-old male client sat down and looked at me blankly. After a time, Ken spoke. \u201cMy life sucks.\u201d I asked gently, \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d He responded, \u201cThat\u2019s the problem, I don\u2019t know ... I do all the things everyone else does ... I\u2019m bored and lonely ... what can I say?\u201d \u201cHow are you bored?\u201d \u201cI hate work because I do the same thing over and over every day ... after work it\u2019s bad because I don\u2019t have anyone to do something with at home. My parents and family live far away. How did my life get this way anyway?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s take a look together. It seems to me that the people who have a life worth living have been able to ask and answer two questions positively.\u201d Ken looked at me directly. \u201cSoooo ... what, pray tell, would be the questions?\u201d Ken said intensely, with a seeming combination of curiosity and impatient irritation. \u201cThe first question has three parts. 1. What do you like to do best? 2. What are your strengths and talents, because you generally like to do what you know how to do easily and well? And... 3. How can you get paid for what you like to do best?\u201d \u201cMy talents don\u2019t have nothin\u2019 to do with making bucks. Soooo ... what\u2019s the other question?\u201d \u201cThe second questions is: \u201cHave you been able to find a"}
{"id": "defining_moments_43", "text": "loving, supportive relationship that could grow and last for fifty years?\u201d \u201cZero on that one, too. No wonder I hate life.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re being very hard on yourself. Let\u2019s go back and work with the questions. What do you like to do best? Don\u2019t worry about whether you get paid for it or not.\u201d There was a long silence while I watched a squirrel walk along the telephone wire outside my window. Then suddenly he sat up straight and took a deep breath. \u201cI love to organize and arrange things. I like putting colors and shapes together.\u201d \u201cThose are important and interesting artistic skills. What kind of jobs utilize those skills?\u201d \u201cWell... now that you ask, I have thought about it. I think interior design, fashion design, or landscaping are jobs that use those skills, but they require education. I didn\u2019t like goin\u2019 to school.\u201d \u201cIf you take the time to sit down and write down on a piece of paper all of the things you love to do, with or without pay, and all of the things you hate to do, you will begin to see a picture of who you really are. Out of that list emerges a number of jobs that would likely make you happy while at work. And ... there are all kinds of ways to learn on-line these days.\u201d \u201cI never thought of looking at my work that way. Someone I knew offered me my current job. I didn\u2019t have to interview, I just took it and assumed I\u2019d solved my career problem.\u201d \u201cYou did succeed in earning money.\u201d I supported, then continued, \u201cI can think of three basic kinds of workers you and I might talk about to help you out. The first kind chooses any job, and does it faithfully; life starts every day after the job ends. Then they do the activities, hobby or socializing that truly interests them after hours\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s been me.\u201d Ken acknowledged. \u201cThe second type of person insists that he train and take on a job that is of real interest and taps his talent in some explicit way. Secondarily, he would like a sustaining salary. Work is his life. He relaxes with time for family after hours.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re suggesting I consider?\u201d \u201cPerhaps ... The third type is an artist. Artists feel compelled to create, using their artistic genes. Often they don\u2019t have a choice. They work hard, but sometimes there is creative work to do and sometimes there isn\u2019t. Therefore, many artists decide to have another job to make ends meet so that worry about lack of funds won\u2019t hamper their creativity. I affectionately call this work a \u2018job-job.\u2019 Sometimes, it\u2019s a job that uses their creativity, too. Other artists may need a mindless \u2018job-job\u2019 so they have the time left to let the creativity percolate. Artists may also need a \u2018job-job\u2019 to keep them in contact with the community so that new creative ideas can be generated.\u201d Ken brightened, \u201cI used to"}

I thought that meant I wasn\u2019t good enough so I stopped. Maybe they just didn\u2019t have enough money.\u201d \u201cYour parents\u2019 lack of interest or resources should not be a deciding factor for you now. It\u2019s your decision, and yours alone.\u201d \u201cI see what you mean.\u201d \u201cIt seems that you\u2019re telling us both that perhaps you\u2019re an artist?\u201d I encouraged. \u201cI guess maybe I\u2019m an artist without support.\u201d \u201cArtists often have had a struggle that compels their artistic genes to create. Sounds like you have both art genes and a struggle in childhood. Congratulations!\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d Ken uttered quietly as he looked up and smiled for the first time. \u201cBefore we stop today, let\u2019s look at the second question. Can you find a loving and supportive relationship that can grow and last for the next fifty years? This question gets easier when you\u2019ve found out who you are and what you really love to do. While you\u2019re out there doing it, you\u2019re likely to meet someone who has similar talents and interests. That person will understand and therefore can be supportive. When you\u2019re ready for her and believe that you deserve her, she\u2019ll arrive. I\u2019ve seen that happen so many times before with previous clients.\u201d He brightened again, \u201cThat sounds like a miracle.\u201d He looked alone and thoughtful for a time. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t get very far with dating because I don\u2019t know what to say about who I am.\u201d \u201cIf you find a job that you really like and it challenges you, then you will naturally feel a pride and confidence that is easy to share with an interested woman.\u201d \u201cYeah, who wants to hear about my boring job?\u201d \u201cYou only need to discover one woman in a city of 13 million.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve made sense of my feelings. I do feel better, but how can I be sure to succeed?\u201d \u201cYou have to make a plan, and then be willing to work on it. Most important is the belief that what you want is really going to occur. What happens tends to be what we believe will happen. Hopefully this hour has strengthened your belief that you can consider carefully what you need in terms of work and a relationship for the purpose of making it your reality.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve given me a lot to think about.\u201d Tom looked relieved and tired. \u201cI\u2019ll make that list and see what develops from my thinking. I guess I have a ways to go, but I\u2019ll get started on the first of two questions you\u2019ve given me before our next meeting. If you can go on helping me, maybe I\u2019ll get where I need to go.\u201d \u201cWe all try to figure who we are and what we need throughout a lifetime. It\u2019s an ongoing process.

I\u2019ll look forward to our meeting again next week.\u201d 19 THREE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS A mother, father and teenage daughter came in to my office as a family for psychotherapy They sat down on the waiting room couch wearily. The daughter pretended to doze off on a pillow. They sat in silence with nothing to say to each other. I wondered why they had come to see me. They did not look at each other. No one wanted to open the conversation once we moved to my consulting room. We began to look at the particular problems that were fueling their silence, not relevant to this essay. In the process of their discussion, the mother asked me. \u201cHow do we get a conversation going at home? We sit down for dinner and have nothing to say to each other. I don\u2019t know where to start. It feels so awkward.\u201d I responded, \u201cThere are three questions that have been extremely helpful for many families.\u201d \u201cPlease go ahead, I need to know.\u201d Dad prompted. \u201cThe first question to ask is, \u2018How was your day today... really?\u2019 This question allows you to find out what has happened that is significant for each person. Don\u2019t interrupt, just listen.\u201d \u201cOK?\u201d... Dad looked at me for the first time. His daughter yawned and seemed to wake up. I continued, \u201cThe second question is very important. Ask, \u2018What are your needs? Is there something I can do for you, or that we need to do together?\u2019 Again, do not interrupt.\u201d Dad chimed in, \u201cWe seem to get into a disagreement quickly because my wife is very critical of our daughter.\u201d That brings me to my third question. Ask, \u2018Do you want to know what I\u2019m thinking about what you\u2019ve said?\u2019 If the answer is \u2018no.\u2019 do not say anything further. If you feel a need to confront, find something supportive to say first. If you\u2019re just disapproving, the other person will shut down or start an argument. If they don\u2019t want to hear what you think, just reflect back what you heard from them. That way you can find out whether you heard it correctly.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care any more,\u201d said Mom, sounding distant and discouraged. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what you feel?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, maybe what I really feel is that I\u2019m a failure as a mother.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Dad. \u201cBecause my daughter does not behave the way I want her to.\u201d \u201cKeep on asking her the first two questions. She will tell you. Maybe she has some really good reasons that you can respect.\u201d Dad chimed in, looking directly at the mother, \u201cThank you for telling us instead of being shut down. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re"}
{"id": "defining_moments_46", "text": "a failure as a parent. I just think you expect too much. Your daughter is quiet because she fears that what she has done will disappoint you.\u201d Their daughter responded for the first time as she moved to the edge of her seat. \u201cYeah, Dad\u2019s right. Whatever I do with my day is not enough for you so I don\u2019t bother to tell you anything any more.\u201d I concluded, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve already told me leads me to believe that your daughter is doing extremely well. There\u2019s much for which to be proud, and you have given her the genes, basic skills and financial support to be successful. I wonder if she\u2019s asking for more psychological support in terms of validation.\u201d I turned to the daughter, \u201cDid I hear you correctly?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d as she relaxed back into the chair, \u201cMom, if I could get more support for what I do right, I would feel safe enough to tell you more. I don\u2019t want any information from you if it\u2019s only critical. If you cannot understand that I\u2019m already doing well, there\u2019s nothing for us to talk about.\u201d \u201cI think your Mom is also saying that she needs some validation as a mom in terms of what she has given to you ... that you appreciate it.\u201d \u201cO...kay,\u201d daughter agreed, reluctantly. \u201cYou\u2019ve managed to start talking with each other. You\u2019ve heard what each one has to say Use the information you\u2019ve received, try what I have suggested, see if it works, laugh a little bit; then come back again next time to tell me what happened.\u201d 20 OUR MOST POWERFUL ELIXIR Everyone who finds the courage to start some psychotherapy tells me that they have been injured in some way. They share their selective perceptions and childhood misconceptions about why this betrayal happened. They generally take more of the blame for what happened than they deserve. In a nutshell, they hurt. They\u2019re afraid, due to feelings of low self-esteem, to do what they really want. There are many ways for me to help. However, the single most important interaction I have to offer is support. Support builds self-esteem, an essential component for conducting a successful life. Through trial and lots of error, I have come to understand that support is: * being consistently available on time * holding an unwavering belief in someone else showing perseverance in helping others reach their own goals * genuine caring * careful listening accurately reflecting asking constructive, respectful, open-ended questions * noticing what is right by looking at the glass of water as half-full rather than half- empty * showing pleasure and giving genuine congratulations when progress is accomplished * interacting creatively, thoughtfully and uniquely with each individual * sharing a related personal story only when it contributes to clients\u2019 comprehension about their life situation. * setting appropriate limits * noticing logical consequences * being humorous in a positive way Confrontation is the highest form of support. It is an interaction that asks another person if"}
{"id": "defining_moments_47", "text": "they can be better than they are now, and encouragingly asserts the belief that they can. However, confrontation holds risk in terms of losing the relationship if the person feels too vulnerable to receive it constructively. The danger of losing the relationship is minimized if the confrontation can be sandwiched between two valid and genuinely positive statements. Giving support is like watering and feeding the soil around a plant that is beginning to droop. Support is not: * advising * lecturing * judging * teasing * using sarcasm * being arrogant * making demeaning remarks * punishing * manipulating * controlling * insisting * convincing another person to do something because it is really better for you, or enhances your own self-esteem. Some persons believe and masquerade these actions as support. However, they are the opposite of support. They are like taking water and good soil away from a plant. These actions lower the self-esteem of both the person who is giving the action and the person receiving it. The biggest gift we can give is to steadfastly believe that others can do whatever they need to do to survive and thrive, especially when the chips are down. Support offered is given in private moments; it\u2019s not for bragging or for someone else to hear. It is sustaining truth, delivered with perspective from someone who cares and knows. Support is gentle, providing a sense of safety that can go a long way to heal past wounds and allow bruises to disappear. There\u2019s nothing stronger than gentleness, working so much better than manipulating, controlling or pushing others to change in the way we might need them to be. When I give support, I earn the trust to hear what it is really like to walk in someone else\u2019s shoes. From that experience, I gain the wisdom needed to support myself and the next person who walks across my path. Both the trust and learning are sufficient rewards. 21 IN MEMORIAM Alison sat slumped in her big overstuffed chair in the dark living room. It was gloomy due to early morning fog off the Atlantic Maine coast. No lights were on. Alison\u2019s brother, Dan, came into the room, looking frustrated with his hands on his hips. The room was cluttered with papers and dishes. Alison\u2019s startled expression told him she had just come out of a daze. He waited. She began slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s November 13. It was one year ago today, you know, that my daughter died in the car accident. I feel so empty. I\u2019m lost in a room so dark that I cannot see the furniture. I feel so angry I could scream. The tears have been leaking out everywhere for days. Somehow, it must have been my fault. I should have done something to prevent it. I should have made her take driver\u2019s training. I\u2019m hopeless because I don\u2019t know what to do with myself. These feeling have plagued me now for one whole year.\u201d \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s"}

Something seems wrong here.\u201d \u201cI know but I want to do something special today because it\u2019s the anniversary of her death,\u201d Alison whispered softly. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to do. I already have some plans for today. I just don\u2019t think she would want you to act this way, a whole year later.\u201d \u201cSome people have told me that the anniversary is when feelings come up, and the second year is harder than the first year.\u201d \u201cYikes! ... Damn ... I suppose you could make it that way if you want grieving to be your life-long profession,\u201d Daniel snapped back. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019ll do something by myself.\u201d Dan walked out to his garage and slammed the back door. Alison slowly dumped her large frame out of the chair and limped across the room. She went out the front door and shuffled her way down the street to the village dock. She clutched a box in one hand that she pulled out of a deep apron pocket. The ferry sounded its horn to announce its departure in five minutes. Alison found enough money in another pocket to climb on the boat just as they were pulling up the gangplank. It was cool but the fog was lifting, giving way to a golden sun reflected by the ocean. Alison found a deck chair and slumped in the same position she\u2019d taken in her living room. She didn\u2019t even notice that she was sitting next to a soldier in uniform. The soldier watched her discreetly in silence for a time while the boat pulled away from the dock. Then gently, he asked, \u201cYou look uncomfortable. Is there anything I can do for you?\u201d Alison stared straight ahead, acting as if she did not hear him. Instead, she watched a seagull circle and land on the flag pole of the ferry. He waited patiently. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s the anniversary of my daughter\u2019s death. I\u2019m still devastated.\u201d He responded carefully, \u201cI can relate to that. My best friend died in the Afghanistan war a little more than a year ago. I was afraid that I would never stop missing him.\u201d \u201cHow did you handle it?\u201d \u201cWell, let\u2019s see ... I grieved for a long time. When the anniversary came around, I decided that it was time to turn my sadness into a memorial. That is ... I guess I decided to give up all of the sad, angry, bad and bitter feelings that engulfed me. I felt like they were draining me of life and making me feel dead.

I remembered all of the best things about my friend and us. I cherished the fact that he saved my life more than once ... What part of nature did your daughter like the best?\u201d \u201cThe water ... the ocean right here.\u201d \u201cMy friend liked gardens. So ... I made a special garden for him with his name on it. I chose flowers that represented his favorite colors. I took the little bit of his ashes his parents gave me out of the box and put them in the garden to nourish the plants ... Did you talk easily with your daughter?\u201d \u201cYes, most of the time. We argued some.\u201d \u201cAfter I finished the garden, I sat down right there and talked to him. I told him what I was planning to do next with my life. I talked to him just the way I always did. I swear I heard his voice say, \u2018Thank you, buddy, go for it. I\u2019ll be with you. You can talk to me any time.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said Alison slowly. \u201cWhat did your daughter like to do best?\u201d this stranger soldier coaxed. \u201cShe loved to come out on the water in a canoe and watch the baby seals.\u201d \u201cIf she were to speak to you now, what do you think she would say?\u201d \u201cShe would tell me to knock off the crying and throw her ashes in the water so that they would float over the rocks to the seals and dolphins. Then she would tell me to get my ass in gear and go to art school, so I could be an art teacher. I\u2019d just started school before she died, but I dropped out with the grief.\u201d \u201cCan you grant her wish?\u201d \u201cYes ... I have the ashes with me ... and I could sign up for a course in January.\u201d The ferry pulled into the next harbor, passing the rocks where the seals lay guarding their young. Alison thought for some time, then slowly pulled the box from her pocket and scattered a few ashes on the water from the boat. She watched them drift toward the rocks and the seals. There were no tears; instead she was almost smiling. She turned to the soldier and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d He nodded quietly, and got off the boat. She returned to her deck chair to make the journey back home. This time she sat up straight. She was filled with feelings that made her strong: willingness, reason, trust, love, and even joy and peace. The boat docked near her home."}

I don\u2019t know where to go or what to do with myself. My wife died six months ago. We were married for 50 years. She was my lover, my friend, my mentor. We worked together in the same business; I had a landscaping firm and she owned a nursery. Therefore, on a daily basis, we had eight more hours together than most married couples ever do. She was a very intelligent lady, far brighter than me. I looked up to her.\u201d He sat on the edge of the couch, glancing uneasily around the room, not sure that he should be talking with a therapist. \u201cIt sounds like you had a very good relationship with your wife for a long time. You\u2019re a very lucky man. However, I bet it does not feel like that now because you miss her so much.\u201d I responded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way. I suppose that\u2019s true. It just feels so difficult now. I don\u2019t know what to do with the grief. I drive up and down the coast, thinking about her.

SUICIDE IS FIRST-DEGREE MURDER Sometimes we human beings reach a point in life in which we feel so discouraged or in so much psychic or physical pain that we decide it would be better if we were simply dead. If you have felt suicidal for some time, and you have already made a plan as to how to kill yourself, you would be most wise to put down this book and call for an immediate appointment with a psychotherapist, or your local mental health clinic. Should these feelings be strongly present after working hours, reach out to a friend, and go to an emergency room or urgent care. Be honest about your suicidal plan. Some of the other essays in this book might comfort you and give you hope while you are waiting for your appointment. Ninety-five percent of clients who have come to see me with suicidal thoughts are making a valid cry for help rather than wishing to end life. The suicidal thoughts make it abundantly clear that their despair is extremely serious. We have always been able to take a thorough history to figure out the specific problems. Understanding is a critically important response and form of caring. We read the negative feelings we find carefully, in small manageable pieces, especially when they are acutely painful. The relationship between us deepens, gives meaning, respect and support. Then, as we are able to look at some solutions to the problems, the suicidal ideation recedes. Some people suffer dark depressions for physiological reasons. They may be lacking sufficient serotonin, have a bipolar depression, have a bad reaction to antidepressant, or become overwhelmed because they are a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP). These people can be helped enormously with the right kind of psychiatric medication, natural medication from a holistic doctor, and/or a change in diet, and psychotherapy.. The correct medication often works within forty-eight to seventy-two hours, giving the client a whole new perspective on life. Persons who have faced a very difficult life may contemplate suicide at some point. However, when they reach out for help, they become empowered to make a conscious existential decision to go on living that remains permanent. I have never met a client who deserved to die. I have seen many clients over the years who mistakenly thought that they should leave the planet. Once we go to work together to make living worthwhile, each and every client over the past forty-one years has decided to continue with life, and has figured out a way to make it better than it ever was before. So ... take heart and reach out for the help you need and resist the urge, no matter how strong, to ever treat yourself cruelly in a manner that could cause death, physical harm or psychological pain while you are alive, or prematurely rob you of your deserved existence. 24 FINDING THE RIGHT PSYCHOTHERAPIST Everyone thinks a long time before they make"}
{"id": "defining_moments_54", "text": "their first appointment with a psychotherapist. They have already tried to fix the problem one more time themselves. It is a big step to pick up the telephone and to make the first call. I have high respect for anyone who contacts me since it\u2019s a major responsibility to have an hour each week to exclusively talk about the self. Because it\u2019s such a big step, I always make time to talk with any new client by telephone. I want each person to have a sense of who I am before they come into the office. I usually ask what happened that made them decide to \u201ccontact me today as opposed to last month or next month.\u201d They will often respond in a way that gives me a preliminary sense of the presenting problem. When my clients arrive, I give them a brief form to fill out and then we sit down to talk for one and one half hours. Each one of us has a job to accomplish during that initial meeting. First, I outline the client\u2019s responsibility. I generally will say, \u201cI\u2019m going to be asking you a lot of questions. You can answer any question you want, or pass on any question since you are still trying to get to know me. Your job today is to sense how it feels to be saying more personal kinds of things to me. If I have any habits, looks, behavior, or mannerism that reminds you of someone who has had a particularly negative impact on your life, I might not be the right therapist for you to see. If this meeting is uncomfortable for you in that way, please let me know, and I will refer you on to someone else. I have a rich referral source.\u201d Then I outline my responsibility. \u201cMy job today is to see if I can understand the presenting problem and what might have already happened in your life to aggravate that problem. If I figure it out correctly, I should be able to say something to you that you may not have ever heard before, but it sounds just right. If I can do that, it usually means that I have located the correct central issue. I can generally get to it within the first two hours.\u201d I also add, \u201cI would encourage you to see more than one therapist for your initial consultation. If another therapist comes up with the same central issue, then you know you are on the right track. Each therapist will have a unique way of working and there are many different theoretical orientations. I will charge you for this meeting only if you go on to make a contract for psychotherapy with me. Then I will charge you the same fee we decide upon for your ongoing work. If you do not return, this hour is a gift to you so that you can afford to move on to someone else.\u201d At the end of the hour,"}
{"id": "defining_moments_55", "text": "I ask, \u201cHow did it feel to do the initial evaluation with me?\u201d I also give each client the option to think about it and get back to me by phone. I feel that it is very important not to attempt to \u201cclose the deal\u201d with a new client. The material we talk about and the nature of the relationship is tender and does not lend itself to any kind of manipulation. Finally, I encourage my clients to ask me any questions they might have about my training, education, and the process of therapy. I also provide each one with a statement about my professional background along with my office procedures, rules of confidentiality, and recommendations as to their options if there is any difficulty with the therapeutic relationship. It is important to me that all clients leave the initial evaluation feeling respected, supported, encouraged, and comfortable with their first psychotherapy hour. Only then will they have the courage to return to say more and more about what is really on their minds. I will be a special private intimate coworker in a truly professional way until their work is done. Then I must open the door for each client to leave, no matter how much I might miss them. A good therapist must be an expert at handling loss. I will not see most clients again. However, our meeting will hopefully have made a critical difference in a very positive way. They will leave with the thoughts and feelings, unique to their situation, which we\u2019ve shared together, now tucked away in their souls. Their work with me will serve as a reminder to them anytime of their right to live a decent, successful life with compassion for themselves and others. 25 DON\u2019T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR A REDUCED FEE If you have finished reading this book and have become interested in doing some psychotherapy yourself, but have limited funds; don\u2019t give up. The ethics of the profession of psychology ask that professionals give some portion of their work to clients without charge. In 1994, I founded and am president of a group of fifteen psychotherapists, THE INDEPENDENT PSYCHOTHERAPY NETWORK (www.therapyinla.com). We all work with some form of sliding fee scale. Many other therapists carry one or more clients pro bono or with minimum charge especially when there is a special need. I charge for the initial evaluation only if the client goes on to make a contract with me. It is always a right to request a reduced fee. Since the therapy process involves regular meetings across time, many therapists will consider a financial arrangement that allows you to afford treatment without interruption. Some therapists will suggest that you can come in for a half hour, or on an \u201cas needed basis\u201d after you have completed some work. I remember my first meeting with my first therapist in 1971. Full fee was, at that time, $35 per hour. I was in graduate school so I could only work"}
{"id": "defining_moments_56", "text": "part time. At the end of the hour, I asked, \u201cWould you work with me for a reduced fee?\u201d He responded, \u201cYes, I would.\u201d I took a deep breath and then offered, \u201cI could afford to see you once a week for $15 per hour or twice a week for $10 per hour.\u201d I waited. He thought for a very long minute and then responded, \u201cI will see you twice a week for $10.00 per hour.\u201d That was a defining moment for me. His response validated my interest and motivation to understand myself as a client in training to be a psychotherapist. This meant a lot to me. At that moment, I made the existential decision to pass the same gift on to those clients with similar need, and passion to understand themselves. The universe keeps sending me some clients who have quickly earned my highest respect and admiration. Go for it, and, if there is a valid need for a reduced fee, don\u2019t forget to ask. III DEFINING MOMENTS WITH FURRY ASSOCIATES MY FURRY ASSOCIATES 26 HOW DOGS AND CATS ASSISTED ME IN THE PSYCHOTHERAPY PROCESS WITHIN A HOME PRIVATE PRACTICE As a clinical psychologist, trained in the 1970s, I was taught to be very sure that my office was quiet, that there would be no distractions to disturb clients from the process of sharing feelings without resistance. It was my job to provide that atmosphere. And for many years, I did just that. I didn\u2019t even display any pictures of my family. My office, although warmly decorated with miniature artifacts from museum collections, was a blank screen in terms of information about my family life. I am writing this essay because so many therapists are moving to home practices. Some are confronting, for the first time, the presence of family pets. The Psychology Examining Committee is sanctioning continuing education regarding Pet Assisted Therapy. Do these therapists allow their animals any contact with their clients? After my adopted daughter arrived, I decided to move my practice to an unusual colonial house in Los Angeles built in 1937. This duplex residence became my solution to the super-mom quandary. We lived downstairs, and my office was upstairs. Each unit had a completely separate entrance. Therefore, my commute to work was just fifteen steps, which gave me more time to spend with my daughter. If she needed special care during the week because she was sick, I could more easily provide it for her. In the evening, I could slip upstairs to finish my \u201chomework,\u201d which modeled a good example for her. My husband could help me with the computer billing and formatting of my manuscripts, while my daughter helped me, over the years, with some secretarial tasks. Fellow clinicians raised their eyebrows when I first moved home. Wouldn\u2019t my clients see too much of my personal life? Might they \u201chang\u201d around when they weren\u2019t supposed to and find out about my family in a way that might interfere with the psychotherapy"}
{"id": "defining_moments_57", "text": "process? My husband and daughter were careful not to be in the driveway while clients were coming and going. Therefore, rarely did they intersect. The therapy seemed to progress well. Clients either asked or figured out that I lived downstairs. Occasionally we would discuss who knew me better, those who came upstairs or those that visited me downstairs? We came to understand that both relationships were special in different ways. My clients never hung around when they weren\u2019t supposed to be there. My daughter benefited from knowing that I was \u201cnearby\u201d even though she understood that there was a strict rule that she could never enter my office when there was \u201ca car in the driveway,\u201d unless she had an emergency. Only once did she break this rule. At a young age she got away from her father and gently knocked on my closed office door. When I opened it, she just stared. I asked why she\u2019d knocked. She answered calmly, \u201cI just wanted to see what a client looks like.\u201d The client laughed, Dad reclaimed her quickly, and my client and I went back to work on the therapy issues at hand. On another occasion, I slipped out to the store for a few minutes because a client had cancelled. I made the mistake of not informing my family downstairs. When I returned, I had a determined daughter sitting on the porch step. She admonished me in no uncertain terms. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever go away without telling me. I thought you were upstairs working.\u201d She helped me to understand how important it was to her that I worked nearby. Our family has always loved animals. Since I married forty three years ago, we\u2019ve rescued ten dogs and six cats. We\u2019ve loved them all equally. They have been free to roam indoors or out with the aid of dog doors and an enclosed yard. I write this essay to share with my readers the warm wisdom, companionship and intimacy that is possible between pets and humans. Now there are certain hazards that have to be overcome if you have a home practice and animals. At a prior residence near a fire station, the three dogs liked to go out on the back porch and howl whenever the sirens blared. The porch was directly above my home office window. Therefore, I had to either lock them inside during client hours or move. I chose to move. Eventually, the animals began in small ways to interact with the clients outside of the office. The cats liked to climb on the hoods of clients\u2019 cars and soak up the warmth from the engine, especially on windy days. Gradually each animal realized that they were missing time with me and they\u2019d better figure out a way to get in on some of the good warm intimate conversation going on upstairs. The first one to figure this out was Nicholas. He was a large, totally black cat who walked like a panther. He was known"}
{"id": "defining_moments_58", "text": "affectionately in the neighborhood as \u201cTHE KING\u201d because he acted like one. He patrolled the street making sure that we were protected from all of the fierce furry things, especially other cats. Any cat who did not defer to him had to face a fight. There were very few challenges. Nicholas made his entrance gradually into my office. At first, he slipped through the dog door and curled up in a corner. He convinced me that he would not bother anybody, so I let him stay. He moved into my lap one evening when I was especially tired because there were several emergencies to handle that day. I noted that his purring gave me energy and made me feel calm and confident. Then he made his debut. A client had just arrived. She came up the stairs three at a time, with Nicholas tailing her. Instead of quietly sitting in the waiting room, as is customary, she bounded into my office and sat in the client\u2019s chair. She was sobbing. Before I could move to my chair and ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Nicholas had already climbed onto her lap and was licking her chin. She sputtered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I barged in. I just discovered that my cat had been killed on the highway.\u201d It was utterly clear that Nicholas already knew what had happened and was comforting her before I could figure out how to help. She hugged him, appreciating his attention. I was utterly amazed in this defining moment. She grieved the loss over time and acquired two new black cats. Nicholas began to show up more and more. Often he would sit on my lap. It was the day before Christmas Eve. Another client was examining the merits of getting herself a pet for Christmas. She was unsure about her ability to be a responsible pet owner. Toward the end of the hour, Nicholas hopped off of my lap and climbed into hers. He reached up and licked her on the cheek. It was as if he had been listening and understood. She took his gesture to mean that she could have her long-awaited pet. I got a card in the mail two days later from this person. She said, \u201cI went to the pound that afternoon and picked out a small black dog. I named him Nicholas because he reminds me of \u201cSt. Nick.\u201d I hadn\u2019t told her the name of my cat, because I was still feeling ambivalent about allowing the animals to be present. I pondered these two defining events. Did this animal know thoughts and feelings that I didn\u2019t? Could he actually be helpful? Was I crazy and just rationalizing his presence because I loved my pets? What about clients who were allergic? Well, I would soon find out. A client walked into the office for her initial evaluation and discovered that I had a cat. She was immediately perturbed but wanted to stay because I had been \u201chighly recommended.\u201d She feared that"}
{"id": "defining_moments_59", "text": "she would have a strong allergic reaction necessitating a call to 911. I asked her if she would prefer a referral. She somewhat fearfully decided to stay to see what would happen, because I explained that I had a very good air filter. She was surprised to discover that she did not have any allergic reaction. Therefore, she concluded her hour by making a contract with me. I kept Nicholas out of my office during her appointed hour. However, it soon became evident that Nicholas had a plan of his own. He would show up in the waiting room every week for her hour. At first he sat in the doorway and just stared at her with an unending look that said, \u201cGo ahead, see if you can sneeze.\u201d Each week he would sit six inches closer to where she was waiting on the couch. As the weeks went on, and she had no adverse reaction, he ventured into the office during her hour. I stayed out of this contest between the two of them, leaving the decision as to whether Nicholas came into the hour completely up to my client. She invited him to come into her session. Just before she concluded her work with me, he managed to hop into her lap. She never sneezed once. I dealt with her other unresolved issues, while noticing that Nicholas appeared to have taken care of her cat allergy completely by himself. This was another astonishing defining moment. I could only articulate Nicholas\u2019s cure as introducing her very slowly, carefully and kindly to the source of her allergy. Since this defining moment, many clients have been cured of allergies to dogs and cats, and fear of animals by the gentle presence of my pets in this office. It makes me wonder about allergies. I used to be allergic to cats myself. It had been widely misconstrued that animals do not have a good sense of time. Therefore, one might ask how Nicholas could possibly keep track of my client\u2019s regular appointment time each week? Is his behavior merely a coincidence? Yet recent studies on dogs say that these animals know when their owners are returning home from wherever they went. The animal will get up and stir or walk over to the window, at that very moment, even if their owner is hundreds of miles away. How do they know? What wisdom do they have that is inaccessible to humans? I have always perceived all of my animals as having a very good sense of time. For instance, Nicholas waited in the bushes for me every morning. When I returned from taking the dogs for a walk in the park, he greeted the dogs by walking between their legs. I\u2019d pick him up and he pressed his head into my cheek on the way to the front door while purring vigorously. This happens every morning. My dogs always knew when it was time to be fed. They barked at my daughter"}

If I see clients past 6:00 p.m. the animals will sit in front of me and stare until I acknowledge and explain my transgression of overworking. Was there a wisdom here that could actually help my practice? The next animal to arrive was Heather. She is a small black and white feral cat with yellow eyes, chubby cheeks, and long white whiskers. She was found in a very poor section of the city, badly dehydrated and very hungry. My daughter, Kendall, was home from school, sick with a sore throat. Heather climbed onto her chest while she was lying down on the bed, and settled in for the weekend by lying across her throat. Kendall and Heather proceeded to provide warmth and healing for each other while forming a lasting attachment. How did Heather know that Kendall had a sore throat? I\u2019m rarely sick, but on the few occasions when this has happened, one of my animals will intuit the place on my body that hurts and will stay with me until I feel better. A client called to cancel her hour with me because she had injured her ankle. She was on crutches. She noted, with some interest, that her dog followed her everywhere she went, even to get a drink of water. He was obviously taking care of her, ready to be of assistance if she fell. It is also well known that dogs know, before humans, when their owner is about to have a seizure, and are also able to detect and bring attention to a melanoma by repeatedly sniffing the area where the melanoma is located. An award was given to a dog by the Los Angeles Humane Society. This animal accompanied his owner on a walk in Griffith Park every day. The owner noted that the dog turned back and started going home just as they were about to climb a sizable hill. The owner had no choice but to follow him, puzzled. When the owner got back home, he collapsed on the floor with a heart attack. The dog knocked the telephone off the counter onto the floor where his owner was able to reach it and dial 911. How did the dog know that his owner needed to go home to get medical attention? What signal do they get that is not available to humans? Thanks to the dog, the owner lived to tell the story. Heather and Nicholas showed up at the end of a client hour together just outside my office entrance. Nicholas had ripped the pad on his paw and was holding it up to show me. Heather sat right beside him beseeching me with her eyes to take him to the vet. Heather was not initially as strong a participant in the psychotherapy process as some of my other animal associates. Instead, she would sit on the steps outside of my office. She was the most feral of the cats. Therefore, she really"}

We know little about her history. Apparently Sasha walked into a grade school classroom one day. A parent brought her home, but traveled a lot, leaving Sasha alone in the backyard with only dry food and water for up to five days. Sasha had some allergies and a thyroid problem. My friend persuaded this lady to give Sasha to us. We drove to the owner\u2019s house on Memorial Day. Her daughter let us in. Sasha was in the backyard. Her back was bleeding and she was so dirty and matted that it took two baths to discover that she was really a white dog. We played with her for a few minutes and found her to be docile and friendly. We had left the door to the backyard and the front door of the house ajar. Suddenly Sasha got up and ran outside to our car. She played briefly with our other two dogs and then jumped into the car. Nothing we could do would get her out. She had made up our minds for us about taking her. The lady who had owned her and a neighbor who had walked her from time to time both cared enough to come to visit us once. They seemed satisfied that she was in good hands, and we never heard from them again. We brought Sasha back to good health quickly. However, she was apparently used to being abandoned. Whenever we took her out for a walk or to the beach, she would find a new family to whom she could \u201cbelong.\u201d She would lie down next to them, just in case we should leave without her. I had always kept my dogs downstairs when clients were in the office. The cats were the only ones to gain entrance through their own persistence. However, Sasha picked up a fox tail. It penetrated her thigh and worked its way below her skin underneath her thick coat. She had to have a surgery to remove it and then wear the inevitable plastic Elizabethan collar to keep her from licking the wound. Because Sasha was miserable with her collar, I let her come into the office one day so that I could take the plastic collar off and keep an eye on her bandages. She was overjoyed to be with my clients and me, lying on the cool hearth near my chair. She remained quiet throughout five therapy hours. The wound healed quickly but not before she\u2019d decided that she always wanted to be in my office. Any time she saw me leave for the upstairs to go to work she would come to my"}
{"id": "defining_moments_62", "text": "side with her tail wagging and her brown eyes staring me down with the question, \u201cMay I come too?\u201d If I hesitated, she would dance a little dance in which she waved her head from side to side. Perhaps she was making up for the hours of loneliness in the previous owner\u2019s backyard. Sasha knew that she had to be quiet in order to stay She could do that for a whole day as long as I took her for a walk each morning. My clients seemed to enjoy her presence. Many of them would stop to pat her briefly on their way to sit down. If clients arrived when I was down the hall or downstairs, Sasha would get up to greet them. She would stay with them until I arrived. I was surprised and appreciative of this sweet courtesy. Although she appeared to be sleeping most of the time, she was obviously listening and completely aware of what was going on. I had one couple visit me with infertility problems. They had tried many different ways to be parents and were obviously getting discouraged. Sasha would get up every time they came into the waiting room. She would wag her tail and sidle up to them as if to say. \u201cYou\u2019ll be good parents, don\u2019t give up, I\u2019ll come and live with you.\u201d Whoops! Now I had two cats and one dog who interacted with clients at will. Sasha was always there, Nicholas was in and out, while Heather greeted clients on the porch. I went on with my work. I always let my clients decide what kind of involvement, if any, they would have with the animals. I ran an excellent quiet air filter in my consulting room. It kept the air clean for all of us and warded off any allergy problems. Only one client, in three years of work, asked that the animals be removed. Each client was given full permission not to engage with any animal. Most wanted to have a brief interaction with a dog or cat, even if it was just a nonverbal pat. The animals rarely approached anyone formally dressed in a three piece suit. They instinctively knew that animal hair was not allowed. Occasionally a cat was dumped off a lap, but the cat was not perturbed, nor was the flow of our dialogue disrupted. I periodically did an evaluation of my practice, specifically asking about the animals. No one complained. Many of my clients were talented, hard-working, responsible people who had lives that were frequently short on unadulterated genuine support and love. Their parents had died, divorced, disappeared, or were too preoccupied with some form of addiction to hold themselves together. Other clients had parents who had, out of psychological need, inadvertently sabotaged my clients\u2019 attempts at success and independence. All of these clients were under-served in terms of unconditional positive regard. First, the positive regard that I gave to the animals was evident. I would sometimes engage in"}
{"id": "defining_moments_63", "text": "a brief dialogue with each animal with such phrases as, \u201cYou know the rules, settle down or go downstairs.\u201d \u201cAre you going to let me sit in that chair or not?\u201d \u201cWow, you look beautiful today.\u201d \u201cYour fur is so soft.\u201d \u201cAre you thirsty?\u201d \u201cDo you need to go out?\u201d Clients seemed encouraged by the kindness between us all. Often when they heard the gentle scratch on the door from a pet, they jumped up to let the animal in before I could. They felt included in \u201cmy family of associates\u201d rather than separated as a \u201cclient\u201d who \u201cdid not belong downstairs.\u201d It appeared that the therapy process took a shorter time to reach a satisfying conclusion because of the animals. Many clients, who did not have pets, decided to acquire one for themselves. Apparently, the oxytocin released by the brain when in the presence of the animals made it easier for clients to talk openly. As one lady said, \u201cI felt so angry when I first came in today. I could not have told you if Nicholas had not climbed in my lap.\u201d Another said, \u201cThese animals are special. They really help us. When a cat gets on my lap and purrs, my voice just takes over.\u201d Other clients would walk into my office and see which animals were present. A few, especially children, did not wish to have a psychotherapy hour without their chosen creature. A fourth client said, \u201cYou should charge extra for the animals; they have something special to add.\u201d A fifth client suggested that I change my sign at the bottom of the stairs to read, \u201cMcArthur and Associates.\u201d 28 NEW CATS BECOME ASSOCIATES My adopted daughter\u2019s birth grandmother was dying of cancer. We went to see her to say our farewell. We had visited her many times over a decade and never knew that she owned two cats. They were apparently afraid of strangers, so they hid under the bed any time company came. On this day, there were many relatives and friends wandering in and out of her apartment, coming to say a final good bye. I was sitting next to Nanna when two large orange cats arrived. They climbed onto my lap. I thought they were trying to visit her so I placed one on her lap, but she was in too much pain to receive them. It became clear that they had come to see me. Were they looking for a new home? Squeaker and Rascals were brothers who had never been separated from each other. They were very large, longhaired, orange marmalade cats. Squeaker was twenty five pounds while Rascals weighed seventeen. In Nanna\u2019s last conversation with me, she informed me that she did not have any relative or friend who wanted to take in the cats. I told her that I would receive them and either keep them, if they fit into our family, or find a suitable home for them. Since I had already adopted her granddaughter, she"}
{"id": "defining_moments_64", "text": "seemed to trust me and appeared relieved. Several days later the cats were delivered to our home. We already had Nicholas and Heather downstairs where we lived, so I decided to start Rascals and Squeaker upstairs in the computer room in my office. After a few days of watching them settle in nicely, I was encouraged to leave the door open. Gradually, over a few weeks, the cats began to migrate slowly down the hall. Clients would stop to pet them briefly. They quickly overcame their fear of strangers. Nicholas and Rascals had one serious fight. Therefore, Nicholas had to stay downstairs, unfortunately ending his \u201cassociate\u201d status in my office. I don\u2019t think he ever forgave Rascals for taking away his job. Within three weeks, both Squeaker and Rascals had decided, without any input from me, to go to work as my assistants. They created their own job descriptions. Squeaker chose to reside in the waiting room and greet the clients while he lay on the couch purring loudly. He was especially warm to any new anxious client, as if to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just tell her what you really feel and everything will come out all right.\u201d Squeaker assigned himself one additional job. When he perceived me to be tired or stressed out by all the psychic pain I\u2019d taken in that day, he came off his place on the waiting room couch and climbed onto my lap in the consulting room. He\u2019d purr loudly and deeply so that I felt energized and massaged by his love. Rascals has assigned himself a completely different job. He\u2019d hide in the book closet in my consulting room and come out quietly when he perceived that a client might need the comfort he had to offer. He\u2019d always show up when clients were dealing with loss, showing tears, anger or confusion. He\u2019d sit at their feet, asking if they\u2019d like his company. If they didn\u2019t want him on their lap, he\u2019d go under the couch, directly below where they were sitting, If the client was allergic and wanted him to leave, he\u2019d do so without a hint of feeling rejected. Rascals has provided significant clinical support many times over. For instance, one day a client was considering the question of whether he should sell his gun to pay another month\u2019s rent, or return to using the gun to play Russian Roulette, flirting dangerously with killing himself. Rascals appeared and offered his opinion in another defining moment. The client was sitting with his hands on the arm rest, fingers hanging limply over the edge of the chair. Rascals climbed upon his lap and put his paw next to the client\u2019s fingers. The client clasped his paw, held it lovingly for a moment and said, \u201cI\u2019ll sell the gun.\u201d This client also entered the Twelve-Step program and has gone on to have a productive life. Daily these two new dear animals wandered in and out of the office, doing their assigned jobs to earn"}
{"id": "defining_moments_65", "text": "their keep. Their presence provided a sense of peace, calm, respect, unconditional love and intuition that was magical for me and all who come through my door to talk. I\u2019ve watched Rascals and Squeaker carefully because they often gave me clues as to what to say or do next. Squeaker died after years of work in my office. He was buried in the back yard under a flourishing pink geranium plant. Rascals grieved the loss deeply by refusing to eat. I had to ask him directly to stay on and work with me without his brother. He accepted. I\u2019ve wondered whether to get him a companion or whether any animal could really replace his brother. 29 NEW DOGS SIGN ON Sasha, the Samoyed, reached old age and died peacefully one day. I was surprised to find out that my clients were deeply impacted. We had to take some time out of each client hour to grieve her loss. After several months, I found another Samoyed in the pound to take Sasha\u2019s place. Angel has a soft seal face with big brown eyes, black eyelids, and white eye lashes. There\u2019s not a mean bone in her body. She lies next to me on the brick hearth, trying to feel the cool through her thick white coat. Two other dogs have also become part of the practice. Teddy is a black Labrador-Great Dane combination. We have speculated that he was likely thrown out of a car on a boulevard and was rescued as he tried to make it across the street when the light turned red. He wanted to be with me so much that, as a puppy, he learned to lie quietly by my side. He never entered a room without greeting the client. Teddy is happiest when he can follow me wherever I go. He\u2019s a natural protector and faithful guardian. If a client appears depressed, Teddy will go downstairs and bring up a stuffed toy mallard duck that squeaks and place it at the client\u2019s feet, inviting him to play and laugh with him. A client who was physically abused as a child reported a dream in which Teddy came and nuzzled his hand. As he spoke tearfully, Teddy got up, came over to this client and demonstrated the identical behavior being articulated within the dream. The client cried about Teddy\u2019s implied understanding. How did Teddy know? Chelsey is a Korean Jindo, abandoned in a local park. She looks much like a coyote. She\u2019s the watch dog over my practice with an unlocked door during office hours. She\u2019s learned the sound of each client\u2019s car and step on the stairway as they approach the office. If the client is new, she will briefly bark. She seems to be checking to see if the client really has an appointment or is, indeed, an intruder. Otherwise, she lies right next to me always. As I was completing this manuscript, Luke arrived just one month after Angel reached the end of her"}
{"id": "defining_moments_66", "text": "life. I was walking the dogs near the L.A. River when I saw a rust colored Great Dane, Ridge Back mix, loping with great speed and the utmost grace of a deer or horse near the water. He climbed the river bank and began to run with my dogs. Teddy took immediate notice, ran with him, and put his head on his shoulder every time this new dog stopped. It was as if he was bringing my attention to this animal. Teddy and Luke continued their play and running together for twenty minutes. This new dog followed us to our car. I wondered what I was going to do. My own dogs decided for me. They climbed into the third seat in my minivan, leaving the second seat completely open for this new huge arrival. I hesitated but invited him into the van. I had to ask three times while Luke looked at the river, at me, at my dogs, trying to believe that he was going to be rescued. He jumped into the car. None of my dogs growled while I drove home. Luke was very thirsty and hungry. A trip to the vet revealed that he had sustained a back injury, and was micro-chipped to an animal shelter miles away. That meant that he may well have traveled many miles up the river to find me and my dogs. We provided our contact information to the micro-chip company, and checked the internet daily, but no owner ever contacted us. Luke is very intelligent, well trained, friendly, and wonderful with children. He had obviously been owned, but was also abused. We could only conclude that he may have been part of the foreclosure tragedy. Perhaps his owner was unable to find an apartment that accepted animals, while the animal shelters were overflowing. Therefore, foreclosed pet owners were dropping their animals along the river where dog owners walked their dogs. Perhaps their dog would be claimed. Another example of the pain the brokers have caused while collecting their fees from owners who could not afford homes. By default, this intelligent sweet dog became ours. We named him Luke. Within days, Luke had discovered my office on the second floor. He proceeded gradually to become involved with the clients. He, too, designed his own job description. He would stand at the door and greet the client. Next he would walk with the client to the waiting room. Then, he lay down next to the file cabinet where I stored the current files and reviewed each file before the client\u2019s hour. When I invited a client into my office, Luke would escort each one in then, sometimes lean into them for a minute to warm their legs. Finally, he would follow the office rule of lying quietly on his dog bed throughout the hour. At the end of the session, he would escort the client to the door. Some clients loved him enough to sit on the floor next to him. Teddy"}
{"id": "defining_moments_67", "text": "and Luke, both half Great Danes, quickly became fast friends. Luke and Teddy were proud working dogs; never missing a client hour even if it meant delaying their dinner. Teddy came to the end of his life at age fourteen (105 years in people age). I saw thirty- one clients that week, and was, once again, surprised at the impact he had. All but two patients noticed immediately, asking where Teddy was. Some clients cried and gave extra support to Luke, who missed his buddy sorely, while continuing to work in my office. Rascals died of old age. I then brought into the office, Rachael, an abused, new female cat. Before she could take up her job, Heather showed up saying, \u2018I'll do it\u201d After years of being a feral cat, mostly outside greeting clients on the porch, she moved into the office waiting room, and then into my office to sit on my lap and occasionally visit clients. Rachael remained shy, so she mostly stays in the computer room to keep me company while I write. Clients frequently commented that they enjoyed and respected the warm and orderly relationship that I have with each animal. It made them feel safe that I would be able to help each client bring some order and limits into their own lives. Since all of these animals have been abandoned in some way, they know what it is like to feel lost, to want to be loved. Perhaps that\u2019s why each animal intuitively appears to understand many of my clients\u2019 needs. Their presence makes all of us feel safe when the office door to the outside world is unlocked during office hours. Each animal has served my clients extremely well over many years. In the final analysis, I\u2019ve allowed them in the office because I can now see clearly what they have provided. Our human brains are condemned to repeat what we don\u2019t understand. Therefore, each client and I have to battle our way through the pain of unresolved issues to reach an understanding that frees each person from the dysfunctional repetition of a past hurt with a significant other. The animals are important to have around because their simpler brains do not hold unresolved issues with the same complexity. Therefore, I conclude that they are freer simply to provide the unconditional love and validation needed to accomplish the difficult work of psychotherapy. Finally, scientific experiments reveal that the presence of animals encourage our brains to release oxytocin, which promotes health and increases positive social interaction with people. I can no longer imagine my practice without these animals. Many of my clients have added a pet to their lives as a result of knowing my animals. It is a well known fact that our blood pressure goes down when we interact with animals and goes up when we talk with people. Do you have a pet to provide the same for you?

{"id": "defining_moments_68", "text": "unknown) entitled, A Dog\u2019s Purpose. This six-year-old watched his family dog being put to sleep. The parents and vet commented upon the sorrow that dogs do not live as long as people. The boy piped up. \u201cPeople are born so that they can learn how to live a good life\u2013like loving everybody all the time and being nice, right?\u201d he then added, \u201cDogs already know how to do that, so they don\u2019t have to stay as long.\u201d The e-mail continues; \u201cIf a dog was a teacher, we would learn things like: \u2022 When loved ones come home, always run to greet them. \u2022 Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride. \u2022 Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy. \u2022 Take naps. \u2022 Stretch before rising. \u2022 Run, romp, and play daily. \u2022 Thrive on attention.

She doesn\u2019t have to pay a dime for it, but she charges her clients fifty cents a minute for calls while she spends hours on her cell phone ... just another way to rake in money while she screws other people.

It\u2019s your reputation that will get you a positive response from other persons of integrity.\u201d \u201cMaybe,\u201d she relented a bit. \u201cI believe that the \u2018fat cats\u2019 think they need more money because often they don\u2019t have integrity, and they are not honorable. I don\u2019t believe they have any peace of mind because the more they have the more they want to feed their ego. No one can really trust them. They think \u2018a little more money\u2019 will finally give them an image that displays a good self-esteem, but it doesn\u2019t. They believe they need to have way more money than is \u2018sufficient to survive.\u2019 \u201d Ruth sat quietly, thoughtful. I continued. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right to spend this hour looking at the difference between success and greed. Success is doing well financially but in a way that helps other people proactively advance their lives psychologically and/or physically at the same time. Greed is taking what you can get for yourself with no regard to how your gain may involve stealing from, being destructive towards, or psychologically detrimental to others. There is a huge difference between success and greed. Success is to be praised, while greed often involves other illegal actions such as lying, fraud and scams. Greed needs to be punished; at the very least, with a loss of title or position. Greed eventually fails; you can see how many businesses are in trouble right now. When that happens there needs to be consequences for the \u2018fat cats\u2019 who hurt people like you.\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m not crazy after all?\u201d \u201cNo, you are richer than your boss because you know about integrity and morality. I think it impossible to have a happy life without compassion, caring, and concern for others. Your boss\u2019s absence of caring leaves her very deprived.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cFurthermore, I believe that you and I can work together in a way that will help you to go on and do something even more meaningful and financially adequate than working for a boss who doesn\u2019t care. Out of this crisis will emerge a new plan for you and your grown children.\u201d I paused again as I watched Ruth look up and smile at me for the first time. I concluded, \u201cWe will think creatively together and discover some people"}

I have respect for the way you have thought it through.\u201d \u201cWell, maybe I can go to work on some of my old dreams I\u2019d hoped to do once the kids were on their own.

I\u2019m glad that you could see me through the anger before it ate me alive.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s one more important thing to say to you. One of my supervisors in my training internship told me something that I will never forget. It has guided me in maintaining my private practice.\u201d \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018There is always, always, room for quality on this planet.\u2019 If your work is of quality, you will not have to advertise. Work will come to you by word of mouth. It will be enough. I have found that to be true for me also. Quality work brings in money and makes a demonstrable difference for others. If there is lots of money, some people like Bill and Melinda Gates and Bill Clinton donate it towards worthy causes. Other people use the money to show their worth and make extravagant luxury for a few. You can tell the difference and choose with whom you wish to work.\u201d \u201cGood thoughts to hang onto. Thanks for the extra time. I\u2019ll see you later this week at our regular time.\u201d \u201cGo for it.\u201d As she left, this time going down the stairs, two at a time, with a ring to her step, I was reminded of a passage from Deepak Chopra\u2019s The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams: (p.29) I wished that I could share it with her boss. \u201cIf we stop the circulation of money\u2014 if our only intention is to hold onto our money and hoard it\u2014 since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into our lives as well. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep the energy circulating. Like a river, money must keep flowing, otherwise it begins to stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and strangle its very own life force. Circulation keeps it alive and vital.\u201d 31 ON BIRTH AND WAR I arrived for the Lamaze class in the early evening, and looked around for the birth mother of the infant my husband and I"}

We were the only female pair. All of the women in the room were with husbands, and showed the gentle curve of pregnancy. I walked over to her feeling awkward and stupidly slender. The teacher moved to the front of the room and began to organize the class. Each couple introduced themselves. She came to us last. Everyone stared. Our birth mother spoke first, and only gave her name. I did not wish to be mistaken for a lesbian couple, so I gave my name and explained that I was a prospective adoptive mother in class willing to learn so that I would be able to help my birth mother during delivery The Lamaze coach proceeded to teach the class. During break, all of the other couples shared an obvious intimacy we could not possibly have. We had known each other only for a few months. Towards the end of the class, the men were asked to give a massage to the pregnant women. I felt even more out of place. However, somehow I managed to accomplish the task. Despite my discomfort, reserve, and shyness in this situation, it was also a very strong defining moment. I had the unusual opportunity to walk in the shoes of a man. I realized just how \u201cnot included\u201d I felt in this process of pregnancy. Birth belongs only to a lady. Sometimes marital problems emerge because the woman feels involved in her new role, and the husband begins to drift away, feeling excluded. The class was intended to help the father of the fetus have something useful to do to help the mother during the often difficult and painful delivery process. It seemed to me that his assignments were downright insignificant in relation to the job the woman does. My husband was not even invited to attend this class. How did the universe give pregnancy and birth to a woman when a man is supposed to be the strong, brave one, taking on the pain and injury needed to protect a family? Is it possible that many men might just feel left out and downright jealous? My father was a physician. He told me that some of the longest and bravest moments he ever saw in the hospital were women giving birth to their infants. However, he was not present for the birth of any of his own three children. Pregnancy and childbirth are difficult and dangerous for women. It is a rite of passage into adulthood that involves risking death while completing the journey. Young men may have a separate need to risk a life threatening situation. What does a man do with these feelings? Suddenly, the defining moment happened inside of my head. I heard the crying out in pain of a woman in labor; and, simultaneously, a man on the battlefield. The sounds seemed exactly"}

I wondered if men solved this conflict over and over again through war, because it was what they needed to do to honor their warrior spirit and feel as brave as women. Men are supposed to be the brave ones. However, war is so much more traumatic and painful than giving birth; resulting in death, injury, amputation, grief, guilt, loneliness, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and recurring nightmares too awful to reveal. There must be a way for men to be brave in a more useful and less painful way. Cable television\u2019s History Channel began to play significant battles every day, all day long. I hoped that if men could watch these shows, they would see how repetitive, useless it is, and how many people suffer and die. Would they conclude that we might need to negotiate verbally to wage less physical battles in the future? But no such luck. If my thinking had some merit, I was left with a few questions. Would war stop if men could become pregnant and deliver babies themselves? If women ran the world, would we talk instead of fight? Have we reached a point in civilization where we could marshal the warrior spirit of men to encompass protectiveness, and negotiation rather than brute force? Would acknowledging the different and competing roles between men and women help us to live more peacefully with each other, with fewer wars? 32 WHEN SOMEONE HURTS YOU Finding your Way to Forgiveness We are condemned to repeat what we don\u2019t understand. If someone did something bad, we may decide to replay it with another person of similar characteristics hoping to understand \u201cwhere we left off and the other person began.\u201d In the process, we can hurt other people, both purposefully and unintentionally. Other people can hurt us for the same reasons. Acting on feelings about past hurts displays what is called an \u201cunresolved conflict.\u201d So ... here you are. Someone has hurt you. It really hurts. Perhaps it was sexual, physical or verbal abuse. Maybe it was neglect, abandonment, sabotage, poverty, addiction, a serious illness or accident. What are you going to do about it? You do not have to feel afraid; you will find the right time to deal with it. You may seek psychotherapy if you feel hit, hurt, demeaned, rejected, angered, guilted, embarrassed, confused, anxious, panicked, lost and/or shamed. Misconceptions can fuel these feelings, leaving a sense of disintegration, desperation and failure. The initial psychotherapy hours are often challenging ones. If you decide to come and talk with a therapist, I can suggest the following journey although it would need to be individually tailored for your particular needs and your own unique life story. You may be able to take parts of this journey on your own by reading about your conflict and writing in a journal. First, we\u2019ll look at what you\u2019re feeling and find the words to describe it. We will honor your feelings since they will guide us through your"}
{"id": "defining_moments_74", "text": "past experience. Second, we will go on a search through your memory of the past, your bad dreams and nightmares and your insights, to recover as completely as possible just what happened that was hurtful to you. Repressed memories may surface suddenly as your unconscious mind listens and cooperates with us. We may be able to talk to the hidden younger person inside you who was hurt, but didn\u2019t dare say anything back then, so that we can really understand. In the process, that younger person will not feel so alone, will be cared for and will begin to integrate back into your adult self. Third, we will look for information about the unique life story of the person(s) who hurt you. We\u2019ll try to understand who these persons were, and why they did what they did to you. We\u2019ll likely see that your perpetrators were also suffering in pain from unresolved conflicts. We tend to hurt others when we\u2019re doing poorly ourselves. Your actions may have innocently triggered their problem causing them to lash out. You are often not the problem; instead they are acting out on their own problem with you. Fourth, we will come to understand the ways in which you survived this event, the courage that it took to do so, and the ways you tried to protect yourself from its happening again. We\u2019ll clarify the ways in which it was not your fault. Then we are ready to replace the old behaviors with new behaviors for the present and future. Fifth, in talking about what happened, we will realize that all of the thoughts, feelings, resentments, bitterness and actions you have previously experienced cannot change the fact that this wrongdoing happened. It will always be with you in your memory. Sixth, out of all of these dialogues, you will come to see that you have love for yourself, rather than shame about the events that happened. You will become a stronger and deeper person if you are also able to muster some compassion for the person who hurt you. You will know \u201cwhere you left off and the other person began.\u201d You will accept that you cannot change the past. It will be clear. Your understanding will likely have brought you towards some degree of forgiveness. Seventh, the events that hurt you in the past will no longer hold center stage in your life. You will not forget, but you will be able to \u201cput it on the back burner,\u201d and make new, healthy goals a priority for yourself. Therefore, you and other people may eventually benefit from the wrongdoing that has happened to you. Because, out of the pain unfolds, like a miracle: \u2022 a foundation of strength and respect for yourself \u2022 a new integrated character that understands both past and future survival \u2022 a new known purpose in how to lead your life. \u2022 a sense of confidence, security, and protection about how to handle inevitable future knockdowns. \u2022 When you have"}

You will come out ahead of where you were before. 33 A CRISIS IS ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY It is September of 2008, and my heart will not stop hurting. It is flooded with stories of people in fear because several natural and manmade crises have happened. Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Ike have swept away countless homes. I see a photograph of a man searching through the outside rubble looking for the neighbor\u2019s cat. Lehman Brothers\u2019 workers have suddenly lost their jobs. They are leaving the building with their belongings packed in cardboard boxes. A father, on the way to see his son get married, was supposedly killed instantly by the Metrolink Freight train crash in Los Angeles, but his cell phone kept sending a signal all night even though he was unable to utter a word and finally expired. If the engineer on Metrolink who made the mistake of text messaging on the job hadn\u2019t been killed instantly, how would he live with the fact that twenty-five people died and one hundred and thirty-five were wounded, many in critical condition? My heart goes out to the families still checking at hospitals and morgues to track down a relative on that Metro link ride. And the stock market is down 1400 points in the last three days, stripping away college funds and retirement dollars from innocent people who have worked hard and now will be in need. As this was happening, the Santa Ana winds fueled fires raging in Southern California. Horses were trapped in ranches their owners couldn\u2019t reach while hundreds of homes burned to the ground. While 45,000 people were in Red Cross Shelters with no homes and no income, CEOs continued to destroy homeowners with unaffordable loans resulting in foreclosures while taking bonuses and salaries in the multi-millions. These images swirled in my mind, churning up fear and anger for all of us. In all of these instances the pain for people directly hit was so enormous. How will these people cope? A crisis can be a danger resulting"}

During these difficult times, I will, of course, help anyone who calls, regardless of ability to pay, to avert such a collapse. However, every crisis also carries an opportunity to climb up on the mental health continuum; to do something completely new, something that each person might never have fully thought out before if life had gone on in the usual way. It\u2019s a time to get back up again to start afresh. A quote on my refrigerator says, \u201cBarns burnt; now I can see the moon.\u201d When a home is destroyed, valuable items are painfully lost; but also, the junk, excess, and responsibility for both are irrevocably cleared away In one of the greatest bestsellers of all times, the 1966 version of Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill tells us: Remember all (people) that succeed in life get off to a bad start, and pass through many heartbreaking struggles before they arrive. The turning point in the lives of those who succeed usually comes at the moment of some crisis, through which they are introduced to their \u201cother selves.\" (p . 40) Remember your health, your strengths, and all of your dreams that may have been forgotten for a long time, because of the daily routine of your present life. Perhaps one of them can now be brought forward to become fulfilled. It may make up for the loss you have suffered and perhaps give you even more. Have faith and the belief that you can do it. An ending is also always the beginning of something new. Take this knockdown as an opportunity to get there. A huge crisis forces an existential moment for society as a whole. We have to make a clear choice. As a culture, it\u2019s an opportunity to look closely at the ways in which we can increase our morality, integrity, compassion, cultivating the ability to acknowledge and help others. It\u2019s a time to give, to be honest with ourselves and others, to create together something new that is better than it ever was before, casting away, once and for all, what really doesn\u2019t work anymore. The freshness of a new beginning has the same magnitude as these painful losses. I ask any of you who have been knocked down by recent events, are you in crisis? Which way are you going to go? Can you pull out of your confusion, shock, helplessness, irritability, and sleepless state to begin to reach out and talk with others, to volunteer, donate, remembering what you still have to build upon? Can you reach out to children and animals, to listen, offer answers to questions and keep them safe? Remember that the universe is watching, perhaps yearning for all of us to emerge as better people. Can we, this time, turn old greed, corruption, scams, fraud and aggression into caring? Don\u2019t get left behind. Instead believe the familiar saying: \u201cAsk and you shall receive Seek and"}

Both were casually but neatly dressed and looked stiffly uncomfortable. They sat on opposite ends of the couch. They did not look at each other. Instead, both gazed apprehensively at me. After I had introduced the process of an initial evaluation, they wasted no time in getting started. Linda opened the conversation saying in a negative monotone, \u201cWe\u2019re here because my husband has had two affairs.\u201d Dan interrupted defensively, \u201cWait a minute. They were a long time ago and didn\u2019t last that long. They were no big deal.\u201d \u201cOh yes, they were! The first one started five years after we married and lasted for several months. The second one lasted for longer than that and took place one year ago ... Supposedly, it ended, but I personally believe that it\u2019s still going on.\u201d \u201cNoooo it\u2019s not. Why do you think that? I\u2019ve told you it\u2019s over.\u201d Dan interrupted sternly. \u201cBecause your cell phone bill still has her number on it from time to time. I check it every day on the computer. And two nights ago, you came home an hour late for dinner. I don\u2019t think you were hungry ... I\u2019ll bet you had dinner with what\u2019s-her-face.\u201d Linda raised her voice to score her definitive point. Dan leaned towards me and started to explain. \u201cShe always thinks I\u2019m doing something bad. Therefore, she gets resentful easily. She\u2019s forever watching me. When I make a mistake, she never forgets. Everything I do goes into the computer file in her head as a wrongdoing ... It\u2019s hard to love anyone who treats me like that.\u201d I\u2019d now heard enough to be able to respond. I broke into the first brief silence. \u201cLet me see if I can help you both a little bit. First of all, the latest statistics suggest that over fifty percent of men have affairs. Twenty-five percent of women used to have affairs, but this percentage has increased to about forty percent. That\u2019s just to remind you that you are not the first or the last with this problem. First, let\u2019s look at what an affair is.\u201d Linda jumped in, \u201cDuh! ... It\u2019s when a guy cheats on his wife. Everyone knows that. But the statistics say I could do that to you, too, buddy. Get it?\u201d She punctuated her thoughts by lightly slapping his knee. I continued, \u201cActually that\u2019s not the definition I had in mind. An affair is a relationship that occurs for the purpose of plugging a hole that exists within the marriage so that the marriage can survive.\u201d I responded. \u201cInteresting. I can relate to that.\u201d Dan perked up. \u201cWhat do"}
{"id": "defining_moments_78", "text": "you mean by a hole?\u201d queried Linda as she suddenly looked caught off guard and confused. \u201cGood question,\u201d I responded. \u201cUsually there\u2019s a problem within the marriage. The couple wants to keep the relationship, but doesn\u2019t know how to deal with the problem. The solution is to go outside the marriage to fulfill some need not being met within the relationship. Then the marriage can go on. Often the spouse left out never finds out.\u201d \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think we had a problem,\u201d denied Linda. She looked at her husband for the first time. \u201cWould you like to ask him?\u201d I suggested \u201cWell?\u201d She looked at him and waited. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to want to sleep with me any more. You were too busy breast feeding the baby. I feel like you don\u2019t have time for me.\u201d \u201cYes, I do ... I didn\u2019t know you felt that way. I thought you didn\u2019t want to make love to me any more after I had the kid because I was still overweight from the pregnancy.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d Dan took a deep breath. \u201cWhatever free time you have, you spend checking up on where I am and what I\u2019m doing. You keep asking me about the affair, over and over, every day. I can\u2019t stand it. I wish it had never happened ... I promise you, I\u2019ve ended the affair. You are the one who is keeping it going by talking about it all the time. How do you think that makes me feel?\u201d I helped again, \u201cThis is tough to talk about, and you\u2019re both doing a good job. I think that your husband has a point worth understanding here. It\u2019s my experience that there are two parts to an affair. One person goes out and has the affair. That\u2019s what Dan did. The person left behind finds out about it and keeps the affair in the middle of the marriage long after the extramarital relationship has stopped. The person left behind watches to see if it\u2019s still going on and demands every detail about what happened. Therefore, both people hold equal responsibility for their part. It\u2019s my experience that the after-math of the affair often lasts as long or even longer than the affair itself. It poisons the marital relationship. The person who strayed finally says, \u2018Well, if she thinks I\u2019m still doing it, even when I\u2019m not, then I guess I might as well just go on doing it. After all, I\u2019m already guilty as charged.\u2019 \u201d \u201cYup.\u201d Dan confirmed with a nod of his head and a stomp of his foot. \u201cSo you did the first part and I\u2019m guilty of the second part?\u201d Linda questioned thoughtfully. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said again. \u201cOhhhh,\u201d she conceded quietly. I continued to encourage them both. \u201cThe good news is that Dan didn\u2019t leave you to be with this other lady. You see, affairs rarely turn into marriages. That\u2019s because they\u2019re only a piece of a total relationship. If the marriage breaks"}
{"id": "defining_moments_79", "text": "up for the affair, the affair almost always falls apart because its limited function is to help preserve the marriage.\u201d \u201cThe affair lady doesn\u2019t get a very good deal then?\u201d Linda inquired. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. They come to see me too. They\u2019re furious.\u201d The wife turned to the husband with tears in her eyes. He reached over and took her hand. She tried to gulp away the lump in her throat, saying haltingly, \u201cDoes she mean that there\u2019s a chance that you still love me? You might really want to be with me?\u201d \u201cOf course, if you can stop thinking I\u2019m cheating on you. You have to believe that I love you.\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m responsible for my part of the hole in the marriage?\u201d Linda asked again for reassurance. \u201cI guess that\u2019s one way to say it,\u201d Dan admitted. \u201cBut we all know my part, too.\u201d They both moved closer to each other. He put his arm around her shoulder. She buried her face in his armpit and sobbed. He comforted her silently. I waited quietly. Then they sat back up and she asked, \u201cCan we come and talk with you more about the hole in the marriage?\u201d \u201cYes, I would be glad to help you with that. Psychotherapy is a good way to talk together about problems that surface for all of us from time to time. I will ask you both about the story of your lives, and we\u2019ll see if there are unresolved issues from the past that might be causing some trouble within your relationship. When those issues are understood by both of you and subsequently resolved, the problem usually falls away naturally. There\u2019s always a reason for a problem. We come to understand that here by using respect instead of judgment and fear. That really helps. And, by the way, talking about it openly is intimacy.\u201d \u201cCan we go ahead and tell you our life stories today?\u201d said Linda, eagerly reaching for more closure. \u201cYes, we can get started in the time that we have left and finish it next time you come in to see me.\u201d \u201cWe should have come here sooner. I didn\u2019t know that therapy could help.\u201d Linda wiped away her tears, brightened some and then offered, \u201cI just had an idea.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dan queried. \u201cMight it be important to share with Dr. McArthur that both of our parents have had a lot of conflict, have gotten divorced and remarried?\u201d I responded, \u201cGood for you. You\u2019re already thinking about your own unresolved issues. We can look into that question much further. The short answer is that many kids who grew up in a home with a divorce are scared that they, too, will get divorced when they grow up.\u201d Linda added, \u201cAhhhh ... and my Dad had three affairs and then my mother left him. I guess they never understood about the hole in the marriage ... and he never married any of the affair ladies. Interesting! My Mom was really hurt"}
{"id": "defining_moments_80", "text": "though ... I guess I\u2019ve just been afraid that the same thing would happen to us,\u201d she said, looking at Dan. \u201cAnd how did you feel when your Dad left?\u201d I questioned. \u201cI was ten, almost eleven. I\u2019ve never felt so scared in my life. It felt like I no longer had a roof over my head. I knew I wouldn\u2019t feel safe anymore. I never want my child to feel that way.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019ve been checking up on Dan partly as a way of trying to protect your kid from a divorce?\u201d I offered. \u201cI guess so,\u201d Linda was thoughtful again. \u201cDo you understand better, Dan, why Linda became so anxious about your actions?\u201d \u201cI never really thought about it that way.\u201d Dan placed his head in one hand and then reached out an arm to offer his other hand to her. \u201cMy guess is that we have done enough for your first time here,\u201d I said. \u201cI think you have a new way to process what\u2019s happened. Perhaps you would do well to think about this hour separately and then share your thoughts with each other at the end of the day. I\u2019ll be glad to work with you further if you decide to return. This relationship sounds important to both of you and your child.\u201d Linda got up, pulling Dan by his arm because they were still holding hands. \u201cI\u2019ll talk with him, but I hope that we\u2019ll be coming back. Thank you for your clarifications.\u201d \u201cThanks and goodbye for now,\u201d Dan smiled. Remember, understanding is one way to love. Enjoy the rest of your day,\u201d I concluded. 35 IT AIN'T CHANGED SINCE THE CAVE MAN DAYS Lois, an exasperated female client, sank down on my couch with her husband and launched right into her session. \u201cOkay, soooo ... Both my husband and I work. Actually, I work a few more hours than he does and I have a longer commute because I pick up the two kids. How, in God\u2019s name, can he come home and calmly sit down to read the newspaper or Newsweek while I can\u2019t even think about plopping anywhere. I have hungry, tired kids, dinner to get on the stove, children\u2019s homework to get started, pets that need petting and feeding, and God only knows what else. I get so mad because he can relax, and I go crazy keeping on working. I\u2019m lucky if I\u2019m done by 9 pm, and then the kids still need to be put into bed. He\u2019ll do some things to help, but I have to ask and define it clearly or his head is back in the newspaper. Are all men like that, or am I just a glutton for punishment? I don\u2019t mean to start the hour bitching, but this is the only place I have some time to say what I feel.\u201d I settled in to help. \u201cYour life sounds like lots of other females\u2019 lives. A number of statistics for dual-working couples suggests"}
{"id": "defining_moments_81", "text": "that women work an average of sixty-plus hours a week while men work about forty-seven.\u201d \u201cWhhhyyy???\u201d Lois shifted position on the couch angrily. Her husband appeared lost in other thoughts as he looked out the window at the sunset reflected on the lake. I began, \u201cEvery married female client has said basically the same thing. I think that it goes back to the basic difference between males and females. Nothing has changed since the days of the cave man.\u201d \u201cExplain ... pleeease ...\u201d my client responded with a touch of annoyance. \u201cWell, the cave man\u2019s job is to go out into the wilderness, whatever the weather, find the bear, kill the bear and drag it back home to the cave. When he gets home, his job is done and he can rest on the floor of the cave. He\u2019s tired, and some of the time he has risked his life.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Lois responds. Her husband is suddenly paying attention. \u201cAnd the women\u2019s job is to cook the bear, make clothes out of the bear\u2019s skin, sweep the cave, gather other kinds of food, and take care of the kids.\u201d \u201cSooo ...\u201d \u201cSo that formula worked basically until we decided that many women want to go out and hunt for a bear, too ... or maybe a goat, or a deer, or some sheep. Thus was born the super-mom.\" \u201cAnd maybe the super-mom is also a necessity financially?\u201d she added emphatically \u201cYes, that is increasingly true with the high cost of living in this city. However, super- mom comes about, her genetics tell her that she can go out and get a bear, or a deer; but her \u201creal job\u201d doesn\u2019t go away. She still has to cook, clean, and take care of the kids. The man gets to rest because he has done his job. We can try to train him to do more, but it does not really fit naturally into his genetic job description. Women want to be out in the workplace; but unfortunately most men don\u2019t want the women\u2019s job.\u201d She added tentatively, \u201cI\u2019m one of those women who enjoys the stimulation of the workplace.\u201d \u201cThe super-mom is working sixty hours a week and that\u2019s too much; but we haven\u2019t figured out what else to do. Men are helping at home, but only when specifically asked. When they don\u2019t initiate help, that does not mean that they don\u2019t love you or respect what you do.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d piped up her husband named Ken. Lois turned towards him. \u201cIt sure feels like you don\u2019t care some of the time. Maybe I could stand it if you would acknowledge my double role by doing something special such as bringing me some flowers ... just every once in a while or for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d I continued, \u201cIt\u2019s my experience that husbands do their special thing.

He finally spoke. \u201cI think what she\u2019s saying is right, although I never really thought of it that way before.\u201d I added, \u201cI think this is the way men are, and that such basic differences are not subject to a lot of change. If we women understand that, we don\u2019t have to feel so resentful, so frustrated, and so hurt as you seem to feel today. We can go on giving them the directions they may need to help us out with our job at home after work. We women can share how we feel clearly, in a way that husbands can understand somewhat. Otherwise, husbands feel like they\u2019re doing their job in terms of bringing home the bear and the buttercups.\u201d \u201cWell, what you\u2019ve said, does make me feel better.

I\u2019ve heard too many men say, \u2018I looked at her job and decided I did not want it.\u2019 Pregnancy, giving birth, and being a super-mom is, in my opinion, a harder job.

She looked at him and smiled. \u201cDo you understand what she said? Can you remember? I don\u2019t always like my cave-man-job in the home either. Do you think we could split up some of those chores?\u201d Ken was now fully engaged. He sat up straight and said, \u201cI was just going to suggest that ... now that I \u2018get it\u2019 better. What if I helped the kids get a snack and do their homework while you start the supper? I think I\u2019d rather do that than have you mad at me.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal. That would be really helpful. Besides the kids prefer to ask you when they have homework questions, anyway.\u201d I encouraged, \u201cGood for you both. Understanding can facilitate negotiation. You\u2019re already doing it. Many dual working couples agree that the chores at home need to be split equally between the two spouses. Each one takes the chores they can do the most easily. Once they decide, they don\u2019t need to talk about it anymore. The feeling of conflict slips away.\u201d \u201cThen there might be some time for us to talk, and even fool around once the kids go to bed, before I\u2019m completely exhausted.\u201d Lois added. \u201cI could go for that result.\u201d Husband slipped one more step closer to her on the couch, and rubbed her"}

FROM FURTHER TRAUMA BY EXTENDED FAMILY Sometimes psychotherapists have to learn a lot suddenly, even after many years in private practice. Three clients, who had been sexually abused, took actions that reinforced what I suspected about sexual abuse victims, their family\u2019s and society\u2019s reactions to their abuse. Family\u2019s response of disbelief and rejection, in each case, created a second trauma resulting in rage turned inward for each client. This result suggests that the psychotherapist has a special responsibility to understand, warn, and then validate the client in preparation for this likely second trauma. During this same week, the magazine Psychotherapy Networker (January /February 2004) article by Bessel Van Der Kolk entitled \u201cIn the Eye of the Storm\u201d arrived in the mail. From the article I learned why sexual abuse victims are very easy to dismiss or abuse again. They have a hard time protecting themselves from further abuse for two reasons. They were put into a traumatic situation where escape was impossible. Their body may have been frozen in time with an active response that could not be completed. Therefore, when the stress level gets high, they may again feel the same kind of physical freeze. Secondly, the traumatic event is stored in the lower parts of the brain (limbic system) and is not easily transferred to the frontal lobes where speech and reason take place. Therefore, it is often very difficult for the victim to articulate what happened in a believable way. This is especially true if the abuse occurred before the time of language development. Therefore, in the real world, their stories do not ring true. Someone can say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d The victims do not know how to fight back to defend themselves. In the last analysis, without support for the client from a psychologically sophisticated knowledgeable outside party, the perpetrators, who are used to deception, easily win once again. It appears that the secondary disregard of sexual abuse from family is almost as damaging as the abuse itself. It is one thing to have something bad happen sexually. It is another for a family member to be a perpetrator. When there is no one else in the family to understand or take appropriate action at the moment or in the future, the victim\u2019s unresolved rage, disappointment and devastation may get turned outwards towards anyone who acts like the perpetrator and/or inwards to become serious suicidal risk. I have always been validating and supportive of clients who have been sexually abused. Most of these past adult clients have never told their families because their intuitions warned them clearly that there would be no support. The clients who have other family members currently at risk for sexual abuse are generally the ones who are forced, by the laws of mandatory reporting, to share these details with family. I have learned that it is essential for me to"}
{"id": "defining_moments_84", "text": "tell my clients that sexual abuse appears too difficult for the vast majority of family members and society to contemplate or imagine, let alone live through. When the client understands this important information, they can avoid feeling traumatized once again, get back on their feet to finish their own work on this issue, and go on with life. It is now understood that Freud believed his female patients when they explained that they had been sexually abused. However, he sensed that society was unable to hear this information. He therefore minimized what he revealed to society by using the label \u201cHysterical Personality.\u201d How far has society come in being able to accept sexual abuse now? The evidence suggests that we still have a very long way to go. In the meantime, appropriate therapeutic support, in place of family, can be life saving. In summary, I can now answer three questions with renewed clarity. 1. How does the victim respond to sexual abuse and telling the family? There are some common responses that are characteristic of most victims. If the abuse occurred before the age of six, there may well be confusion as to the identity of the perpetrator and the nature of the sexual intrusion. Victims are often confused about what it means to tell the truth because the perpetrator has taught them to lie. Most victims fervently hope that what happened was not really abuse or that they are remembering something that actually did not happen. They worry excessively about misrepresenting themselves or their perpetrators. Some victims experience a somatic response as the body\u2019s way of communicating that the abuse really happened. This pain can be every bit as painful as the original sexual abuse encounter. I have seen the longing to be believed and understood by family and also the power that therapeutic understanding and even minimal family support brings to return victims to fuller functioning. Under pressure, the victim can dissociate or psychologically leave their bodies because that is the coping behavior they learned while experiencing the abuse. They feel worse than a \u201cdirty dishrag\u201d because they were abused. Since a perpetrator tends to look \u201cthrough\u201d them rather than \u201cat\u201d them while the abuse is happening, victims tend to feel that their existence and feelings are completely unimportant. In addition, the immature child\u2019s brain views grownups as all powerful and perfect, leaving the child totally to blame. There is hurt and rage when the family members support the persecutor and deny the victim equal rights. There can be confusion about enjoying or hating sexual relations, especially if their current sexual partner does something that reminds them of the former abuse, even if it is gentle and kind. Rage can turn inwards as suicidal ideation. 2. How does family and society respond to a sexually abused victim who tries to address what happened in the past? Perpetrators tend to deny, disappear and quietly go on acting like perpetrators. Someone who is falsely accused, in marked contrast, tends to"}
{"id": "defining_moments_85", "text": "engage easily and responds with compassion, concern, sadness, and caring. In most cases they stay with the issue until resolution is achieved. Sexually abusive behavior appears to be so unacceptable that some family members prefer to immediately reject it. They act incapable of considering that it might have happened and imagining what it must have been like. Some knew that the abuse was happening at the time but systematically ignored the signals. Sometimes, they are completely unable to respond to this shocking information. It is therefore predictable that they should become defensive by turning a blind eye. It is far easier to respond with hostility, rejection and direct punishment while the victim is too immobilized to resist. Silence from a family member may mean that person has also been sexually abused. The victim faces new trauma by this kind of family response and is, once again, devastated by the dismissal of information and lack of support. 3. What are the therapist\u2019s responsibilities? It is imperative to avoid new trauma caused by the family\u2019s defensive hostility whenever possible. The therapist must provide the belief, respect and support that are missing from the family. It makes sense to believe the client because the details of the sexual abuse are too unpleasant and unique to make up. It is important to consider very carefully with the client whether to tell the family if the statute of limitations has expired, and if there is good reason to believe that the abuse is not continuing with any other victim. The therapist and the client must weigh carefully the advantages and disadvantages of revealing the abuse to the family The client\u2019s opinion is very important since the client knows the family members better than the therapist. When the case requires mandatory reporting, the client needs to be fully informed ahead of time that the family is not likely to be responsive in a positive way. The family\u2019s behavior does not mean that the client is bad or is lying. The client needs a clear explanation that s/he is never to blame for the abuse or the reporting because the victim\u2019s immature, underdeveloped childhood brain can only misconstrue that it was the child\u2019s fault. If the abuse is confronted, or the abuse is reported to the Department of Child and Family Protective Services, the therapist has to be available to help the family through their defenses to their own underlying horrified feelings. Revealing abuse always constitutes a family crisis. This is often difficult, if not impossible, when the family doesn\u2019t want to be involved or lives far away. Therefore, the decision to report is often fraught with deep conflict for the therapist. The therapist needs to be available on a long-term basis to help the family or effectively refer the family to another therapist. Families of my clients need the information about psychological and physical reactions to abuse so that the family can stop viewing the victim\u2019s minimal response as \u201cincompetence\u201d or \u201clying.\u201d The goal in such"}
{"id": "defining_moments_86", "text": "long-term work is to help any family member willing to believe the victim, and to understand that their support is critical in the healing process. We can actively celebrate and compliment any family member who is able to understand and be supportive. We can also help families, inasmuch as possible, not to fragment by taking sides and rejecting anyone. This is especially important for family events such as holidays, decade birthdays, births, weddings, anniversaries, and funerals. The July/August 2003 Psychotherapy Network magazine has a specific article on how to bring a family disrupted by sexual abuse allegations together for weddings and funerals without fragmenting further by arguing about the abuse. The therapist can always hold on to the hope that the family will, in time, come to a more understanding position. To promote this, the therapist\u2019s door needs to remain open, especially for other members of the family that may have been abused. 37 TO PUNISH OR HELP, THAT IS THE QUESTION I started a consultation with an adult client, Ann, and her mother, father and brother. \u201cWe are here today to talk about how to handle the knowledge we now have that Ann appears to have been sexually abused by her cousin, Alan, over twenty years ago, when she was a child. Her Aunt Betty was taking care of your children, Mom and Dad, while both of you worked a second job. Ann has now told all of you. Is that correct?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re meeting to understand how you all feel about this news, and to decide how to handle this information with Alan and Aunt Betty. A holiday season is fast approaching when all of the family gets together.\u201d Mom chimed in, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen or spoken to either one of them for a month since we learned about the abuse. I don\u2019t care if I never see them again.\u201d \u201cAnd Alan should suffer some consequence for what he did. People go to jail for stuff like that. I can\u2019t pretend that nothing happened,\u201d added brother knowingly. Dad was very quiet. \u2018What do you think?\u201d I asked gently. \u201cI would have to talk with Alan first before I made any judgment. I have no idea what to do just now. You got to understand; he hurt my baby.\u201d \u201cI do understand,\u201d I reflected. \u201cWe have to do something ... if we see Alan and Aunt Betty at Easter dinner, one of us will surely slip and say something that would give away what we know.\u201d suggested the brother. Everyone turned to Ann to say, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to work on the issue of abuse here with Dr. McArthur. Believe me, I\u2019ve been mad and sad. But I have come through the anger at Alan pretty much. You have to remember that he and I were also friends for most of my childhood. We did lots of good things together, too. I was able to talk with him on the phone"}

I think, for right now, I just want to finish up with my own psychological work.\u201d \u201cBut what he did was really bad.\u201d Mom emphasized. \u201cYou\u2019re right and entitled to your feelings, especially as the mother of Ann. Does doing something bad make him a bad person?\u201d I queried. \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d Everyone nodded concurrently. \u201cHow about describing him as \u2018troubled?\u2019\u201d I suggested. \u201cYes, we agree that he has been troubled for a really long time.\u201d nodded everyone in agreement. \u201cThere\u2019s ample evidence about that. He\u2019s really difficult and angry much of the time, especially with Aunt Betty.\u201d \u201cHow do you want to respond to someone who\u2019s troubled?\u201d I nudged. \u201cYou mean we should be helping him?\u201d Everyone looked surprised and irritated. \u201cPerpetrators of sexual abuse and those with deviant sexual fantasies tend to be people who feel extremely lonely and have a very low self-esteem. They tend to think that if they can create sexual arousal they will feel better about themselves and more powerful, at least for as long as it lasts. I wonder if Alan felt the same way?\u201d \u201cBut he hurt Ann,\u201d Brother reminded me. \u201cThat\u2019s indeed true. But are you just going to hurt him back? What would that accomplish?\u201d Mom chimed in. \u201cWhen people hurt me, I just cut them out of my life. Then they\u2019re gone. I\u2019ve been doing that all of my life. It works well in the sense that I don\u2019t get hurt anymore by that person.\u201d \u201cWhen something bad happens, that is often the easiest time to learn to cope in a new way.\u201d I encouraged. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.\u201d Mother drew back in her chair. \u201cWhat about Aunt Betty. She\u2019s just as much at fault; she should have known that sexual abuse was going on,\u201d added Brother. \u201cBut, she\u2019s very old and tired now. It would just kill her to find out what had happened. It was a long time ago,\u201d reminded Dad. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that she really didn\u2019t know any more than you did,\u201d I suggested. Mom tried again, \u201cI guess I need somebody to blame so I don\u2019t have to feel so guilty that this all happened. Ann wanted to know why we left her with her aunts and Alan. We had to earn extra money. I had no idea that this was going on. It never happened when I was a kid, and I played with cousins my age throughout my childhood.\u201d \u201cAlan is not a stranger, but a family member. Perhaps we could say that love is the only response that\u2019s never wrong. We are taught as doctors to \u201cDo No Harm.\u2019 Someone in your family has already been hurt. Do we want to add to the hurt, or try to help so that it won\u2019t happen again with anyone else? Could we use that principle here?\u201d I questioned her. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to love when I feel angry and guilty.\u201d said Mother."}

You are the only ones who can decide, because you know the people involved. I can only suggest the following: What if you were to write a letter to Alan from all of you? You could let him know that you are aware of the abuse accusation. You would be confronting him, which is an interaction that is a high form of caring. You could tell him that Ann has gotten some help in the form of psychotherapy, and that she\u2019s doing well. You could offer him some referrals for psychotherapy also. The psychotherapist could then evaluate him in regard to his present behavior, and decide about treatment, and reporting options. That would be a gift that provides structure and control. Maybe it would help him rather than hurt him, making everyone feel better. Then you could start talking to each other again. Ignoring Alan and Aunt Betty makes everyone lonely and is a dysfunctional response. They must feel very rejected and without knowing why.\u201d Ann had been twirling an elastic band around her fingers. She stopped, looked up and said, \u201cI like that idea. He\u2019ll hurt in therapy like I did, but it would be a good kind of hurt. It would make him better if he could stand it.

If you decide to write a letter, you could fax it to me to review, if you want. We can also meet again to work through your feelings before you decide.

You have gone further than many families in your discussion. I\u2019ve seen families who simply reject the victim because they cannot cope with the truth. You have shared normal feelings most people feel when they hear about any kind of abuse. As a family, you may be able to go beyond these expected feelings to a solution that will make you all feel that you have grown instead of feeling weakened.

This was a pleasure to see because she"}
{"id": "defining_moments_89", "text": "has been dealing with a separation from her husband. She began our psychotherapy hour right away. \u201cI went out to a party with a friend last week. I met a man. His name is Alex. I don\u2019t really know how it happened, but, I guess you could say, we were both attracted to each other. He noticed me, I watched him, he followed me around, I knew where he was all the time. We talked together really easily.\u201d \u201cSounds like fun for you after a long time of sadness.\u201d \u201cI think so too, but I was also puzzled. As you know, I have been dating two other guys who are really nice to me. However, I found myself thinking about Alex much more even though I do not know him as well. I\u2019m not sure why, or whether my thinking is right. I\u2019m not sure what attraction is or means.\u201d \u201cI have heard clients talk with me about three different kinds of attraction. Perhaps you are asking which kind of attraction you were feeling.\u201d \u201cWhat are the three kinds?\u201d \u201cThe first kind of attraction, I call a physical one. Your body, and his body say, 'It would be so nice and feel so good if we could get together physically.\u201d \u201cYah,\u201d \u201cThe second kind of attraction is an attraction of mutual strengths. You are both interested in the same kinds of things, have some similar and some complimentary talents, and are at the same level of psychological maturity. \u201cThat feels more like what we felt.\u201d \u201cThe third kind of attraction occurs between your unconscious and his unconscious. You are attracted to each other because he reminds you of someone significant in your life story who disappointed or hurt you in some way. In a like manner, you remind him of someone in his life that represents his unresolved issue with someone in his past. In other words, two unresolved issues hook up in a mysterious magnetic way. They are replayed and intertwine in a way that usually disappoints both of you a second time. The magnetic attraction can feel instantaneous and really strong.\u201d \u201cWell ... that sounds like a possibility too.\u201d \u201cMost relationships are a combination of all three. If the second kind of attraction is strongest, the relationship thrives, and often deals with smaller unresolved issues over time. If the third kind of attraction is the strongest, the relationship generally ends up with a separation.\u201d \u201cSo, you must be saying that it is important to figure out which ones are driving the coming together.\u201d \u201cGood for you to see that ... Tell me, what did you find out about Alex?\u201d \u201cI kept thinking about him because I wanted him to call me. I found out that he is very busy. He is working in a job full time, going to graduate school to get a PhD in conducting, and he plays organ for church jobs. So he really doesn\u2019t have much time for a relationship.\u201d \u201cDoes that remind you"}

Don\u2019t you want somebody to love? Don\u2019t you need somebody to love? Wouldn\u2019t you love to love somebody to love? You\u2019d better go find somebody to love. The Jefferson Airplane Many clients ask what makes romantic love last at some point within the psychotherapy relationship. poets, psychotherapists, philosophers, writers, teenagers, and parents have sought the ultimate answer to this puzzling question. Many clients feel that they have not experienced romantic love, or saw it modeled by their parents. I have an answer that comes from my own marriage of 43 years and my experience with clients\u2019 life stories. It is only my answer; I cannot claim it as a universal truth. First, it is important to say that I believe we humans are inherently social beings. We want an intimate relationship with each other. How do we find such a relationship? Dating is very hard. The entertainment industry likes to portray in the movies a loving relationship as easy and effortless, leaving all of us feeling a little bit inadequate. However, in the movies, actors and actresses get to use as many \u2018takes\u2019 and \u2018cuts\u2019 as it takes. In real life, we have to make instant decisions about what to say, how much to tell, when to touch, when to \u201chave sex,\u201d or when to \u201cmake love\u201d after the relationship is developed enough to talk about STDs and other personal private matters. Healthy relationships that last forty to fifty years are made slowly, deliberately and carefully with thought and verbal sharing, resulting in a common consensus. Forging the beginning of a romantic relationship can feel as difficult and intrusive as taking the SAT or GRE, going for a job interview, and enduring a physical examination. Two people come together, \u201cattracted to each other.\u201d This attraction is an arrangement of sorts, impossible to describe because it is different for each couple. There is a magic to it; perhaps the intelligence of the universe is the only one to truly understand. There is already obvious chemistry. However, I believe two people have to build and then tend an underlying foundation that turns a meeting of attraction into"}

No one can or has to be perfect. 40 WHAT GOOD FRIENDS CAN DO BUT OFTEN DON\u2019T Family relationships are very important, but often have long-term conflict embedded within them. Perhaps we could say that one of the reasons we have friends is because family relationships can be so complex. Friendships are often easier because they are less complicated, less loaded, and more straight-forward. They can be nourishing, supportive, long-term and deep. Other friendships come and go, as the goals, passions, and needs of each individual moves in different directions. Over the years, I've helped many clients process relationships not only with family, but also with important friends. We are inherently social beings, enjoying contact with each other. I hear over and over again from clients that there are four actions friends can take that contribute markedly to the intimacy and long-term survival of the relationship. Unfortunately, these actions are sometimes absent or incomplete. The first action is to get to know your friend by asking questions that would help you to understand what it feels"}
{"id": "defining_moments_92", "text": "like to walk in their shoes. We can do this with interest, rather than being superficially cheerful, pretending with a false self to be a different person than you really are, being demanding, controlling or over adaptive to a fault. The second action is to share with a friend out loud what we admire about them. Often we notice, but fail to share this valuable information. We all need to be told when we\u2019re looking nice and doing well. It helps immensely to contribute to an optimal internal level of self-esteem that encourages and sustains relationships. The third action is to first recognize our feelings and then verbalize honestly out loud when a friend has taken an action or acquired something that makes us feel threatened, jealous or envious. Such feelings can happen normally when a friend purchases the home we\u2019ve always wanted to live in, buys the sports car we\u2019ve longed to drive, gets the job, degree, or award we\u2019ve coveted, or produces something artistic in the field of music, drama, dance, visual arts or literature. During these times, friends sometimes give a dysfunctional response of sarcasm, gossiping, going silent or retreating. They don\u2019t show up for the house-warming party, or the book signing, gallery opening, or award ceremony. The person who has acquired something suffers from feelings of rejection and alone-ness. My clients learn to read their friends\u2019 behavior as a \u201cbackwards compliment\u201d which means that the client has indeed created or done something significant and worthwhile. Many people believe that jealousy is a dysfunctional feeling. Instead, I see it as merely one of many negative emotions that tells us clearly that we want something that someone else has. Therefore, it is preferable and acceptable to maintain the relationship by saying out loud that we\u2019re feeling a longing or a jealousy to have the same thing a friend has just acquired. By admitting these feelings out loud, we acquire the chance to understand what we want and can begin to move into a position to acquire it. The friend can often be of help and will understand. This action, then, strengthens the relationship. The fourth action would be to come forward and address any problems within the relationship in a constructive way. It takes courage to address a concern, and insight to resolve it. When we have outgrown teachers and parents, we learn most things, as an adult, by trying something. In the process, it\u2019s human to make mistakes, to say or do something that is inadvertently or intentionally hurtful in a way that gets us into trouble with a friend. When that happens, some friends silently pull away instead of addressing the problem constructively. If a confrontation is in order, it can be sandwiched between two positive statements. My clients always appreciate it when a friend takes the courage to address the problem at hand. Clients bring the information back to me so that we can figure out what change needs to take place.

Once again, meaningful help is often exchanged to deepen the relationship. Technology has given us a new form of communication. We are talking with each other about important emotions and plans through e-mail, texting, blogging, and instant messaging. The younger generation now has internet MySpace and Facebook in which they can suddenly silently be eliminated by an angry friend without explanation. Those who work in cubicles are said to be distracted from work every three minutes by communications from others that takes up twenty-eight percent of work time. Perhaps it\u2019s a way to measure how many friends we have and who cares. However, this form of communication only uses two-to-five percent of the total interaction with each other. Telephone brings it up to twenty percent, while a face-to-face contact is one hundred percent. Important conversations are easy to misinterpret by these newer forms of technology. Hopefully we are not missing out on getting together where we can see important information presented through facial expressions, tone of voice, and other nonverbal communications. Occasionally one of my clients takes the courage to call a friend who has slipped away, and ask what went wrong. If it\u2019s really important, we may invite the friend to come into a portion of a therapy hour, as a significant other to the client, so that we can constructively figure it out without judgment. We use reflective listening together until we can shape a solution that represents a constructive integration of feelings. I\u2019ve spent hours with my clients, on their dime, trying to figure out or guess what a client did that made a friend pull away Did we come up with the right answer? When a friend does speak truthfully, it may well become a defining moment for all of us. 41 ARTISTS AND SOCIETY I have seen many artists over the years as clients in my private practice. They walk into my office with a humble quietness. They see the world deeply through an exquisite lens and can feel sadness, concern, disgust, and triumph about civilization and joy about nature easily. Many artists have a need to understand and are deeply impacted by the poignancy of their own life story They often experience themselves on the outside of the \u201cin\u201d crowd in childhood, and can be bored in school. Some have become accustomed to putting themselves down because it\u2019s commonplace for artists to have doubts about the validity of their creative endeavors. Many of these clients have silently discounted their creative genes because their parents did not acknowledge or encourage them to actualize their particular talent. Instead, family responded cautiously because they were afraid that their artist child would not be able to make a sufficient living by practicing their art. Parents may encourage a degree in business, or law instead of a degree in fine arts. As a result, many artistic clients view their opportunity to"}
{"id": "defining_moments_94", "text": "create as an \u201cextravagance\u201d they should not bother to indulge. Being an artist is one way to make sense of and express feelings about living life on this planet. An artistic piece of writing, exhibition, or performance can bring forth and regroup feelings we didn\u2019t know we had buried deeply inside us. Art can reach out and aid a viewer the way a therapist helps each person reach a resolution. When an audience gathers to watch a movie, play, concert, poetry reading, or dance performance, they mutually agree to study together whatever the artist has decided to say. However, clients come to realize they are artists when they use their particular talent in a way that feels effortless, and brings contentment with results that make them feel proud. A few are so passionate and compelled that they do not have the choice not to be artistic. Some feel their creative expression comes \u201cthrough\u201d them from the outside world, while others feel it is generated from \u201cwithin\u201d themselves and their life experience. Still others feel their creative expression comes from both sources. Whichever way it happens, the creative work of an artist has to be a solo journey until the creation is completed. It is important to suspend judgment and detach from the outcome to let the creative idea unfold. Sometimes that journey leaves the artist feeling isolated, different, alone and afraid. When the creativity is completed, others may become involved in getting it out into the world. Throughout my own life as an artist and psychotherapist, and many hours with clients, I\u2019ve come to understand that society and the world in general often does not treat our artists well. I believe that most people are jealous of artists, especially the ones who get to perform in public. Probably everyone has had dreams of being in the \u201climelight\u201d with that wonderful high moment when artists are performing and their creativity is appreciated. Many get to hear the clapping and to feel that they have done something truly meaningful and important. Artists tend not to be interested in riches or fame. Instead, they just want enough support to go on doing their creative work. Many famous artists have lived in poverty. What are the words that the culture so frequently articulates just before the word artist? The answer is, of course, \u201cstruggling\u201d and \u201cstarving.\u201d Perhaps, because society is jealous, they make artists create and complete most of their projects with no financial compensation. Maybe they\u2019ll look at their work after it\u2019s done, and maybe they\u2019ll respect it, and maybe they won\u2019t. Often they don\u2019t even bother to look carefully or even respond. In the meantime, they give artists little hope. They think nothing about discounting them and their creative endeavors. Especially, actors and authors have to be experts at handling rejection after rejection as an expected and normal part of the process. Artistic clients come to me to quell their fear, acquire a strong enough self-esteem to survive society\u2019s tentative response. It"}
{"id": "defining_moments_95", "text": "would be outstanding if society could take a step forward and treat our artists with the utmost respect. That support starts right in my office. Many of these clients are often Highly Sensitive Persons (HSP) with an overly tuned response to one or more of the five senses. Artists are our deep thinkers with acute intuition; our quiet and honest leaders, observing, creating and commenting on what we most need to hear as a society and as individuals. Artists risk saying something really important, even if they get rejected. They tend not to stay on the well-worn path, but to carve new trails. But often, society is reluctant to hear what artists have to say, because maybe they will have to alter the way they do things as a result of artists\u2019 input. Therefore, they shut artists up with lack of support, ignore them, or criticize them. Many famous artists have become known only after they\u2019ve died. In writer\u2019s workshops, authors are often encouraged not to write unless they absolutely can\u2019t live without putting words together in that effortless way that brings contentment. After the first draft, there is a lot of editing to finish each piece of writing. Success is difficult and often elusive. There are two conditions that contribute to becoming a successful artist. First, the person has to be born with creative genes. The second condition is always a surprise to my artistic clients. Artists are often involved in a struggle, such as a difficult childhood, that becomes well understood by the client in terms of emotions and misconceptions. The resolution of this conflict often gives shape to the particular subject and expression of their creativity, while lack of resolution may block expression. As the clients and I work on their unresolved issues, their creativity is able to flow freely again. Their resolution shapes an important creative endeavor that can make a difference for those who may suffer in a similar way. My clients and I have been trying to find or create a word that explains the quiet joy that is happening when an artist is in the act of being truly creative. Clients have been using such words as \u201csurrender,\u201d \u201csomething bigger than yourself that teaches something about yourself,\u201d \u201cabandon,\u201d \u201clost in an energy of potential,\u201d \u201c connected so that nothing else is in focus or matters,\u201d and \u201csolitary.\u201d \u201cBeing creative presents the only time I can truly love myself.\u201d \u201cCreativity is like a cat, it comes out when it wants to.\u201d As pianist, Karl Paulnack said, on March 2, 2009, in his welcome address to the freshman class at Boston Conservatory, \u201cMusic allows us to move around those big invisible pieces of ourselves and rearrange our insides so that we can express what we feel even when we can\u2019t talk about it. \u201d Deepak Chopra in The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to Fulfillment of Your Dreams explains it, but is also unable to do it with a single word: This"}
{"id": "defining_moments_96", "text": "exquisite combination of silent unbounded, infinite mind (of the universe) along with dynamic bounded, individual mind is the perfect balance of stillness and movement simultaneously that can create whatever you want. This coexistence of opposites makes you independent of situation, circumstances, people and things. As Julia Cameron writes about the results that come out of creativity in Walking In this World: The Practical Art of Creativity: Artists: 1. explore the territory of the human heart, braving the dark woods to report to our human tribe that a trail can be found and will survive. 2. report dangers we might wish to ignore 3. record perceptions that feel unbearable to others 4. encapsulate the loneliness of missed connections 5. function out of nerve, daring, stamina, vision, and persistence It\u2019s exhilarating for me to watch artist clients awaken to their creativity, to own it and begin talking about their particular project. Sometimes we look together at ways they can support themselves with what we affectionately call a \u201cjob-job\u201d so they can save most of their energy for their creativity. The \u201cjob-job\u201d pays the living costs and takes away the struggle to pay for rent and food that otherwise could erode the creative process. Many artists do not seem to have marketing and publicity genes, so they have a hard time promoting their work. Hence, society steps in with publishing houses, agents, publicists, and marketing experts. Artists don\u2019t want to tell people what they\u2019ve done or try to sell it. They just want to get on to the next project. Secondarily, they\u2019re happy if they can be financially successful, but their primary interest lies in making a difference by articulating what needs to be realized. It\u2019s hard to kill an artist\u2019s drive, especially when each artist becomes an expert at rising above or ignoring sabotaging remarks, meant to clip their wings in place of useful criticism. With enough encouragement and support, the artist will prevail. Two quotes speak poignantly to this issue. One of life\u2019s most exhilarating feelings is to be shot at with no result. \u2014Winston Churchill All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as self-evident. \u2014Arthur Shopenhauer I encourage my clients to listen carefully to their creativity and intuition. When they have the urge to be creative, they\u2019re being sent a message from the universe to act. The universe is so much more intelligent than any one human artist that it becomes ridiculous to resist. Only the potent energy of the universe knows the whole picture. The artist merely has to do what is suggested through their creativity. All fear of failure, evaluation, judgment, or rejection of the work has to be sent down the drain of the artist\u2019s daily bath or shower. These feelings will only cause writer\u2019s block eroding the process of producing valuable works of art for us all. On March 2, 2009, pianist, Karl Paulnacks\u2019s concluded in his welcome address to the freshman class at"}

Currently, eighty percent of my clients are artistic. They leave my office when we have worked with all of the above issues and they: 1. understand and respect their particular creative genius 2. have found and accepted their \u201cjob-job\u201d when it is needed 3. feel entitled and compelled to use their artistic genes 4. understand the unresolved issues within their own lives and have some artistic way to express them to help others with similar problems 5. have mastered their fears of rejection and are able to create anyway 6. can distinguish between useful constructive criticism to be incorporated, and sabotage based upon threat and jealousy that must to be eliminated In the final analysis, it is powerful and compelling and hard to be an artist. 42 THERE IS A QUIET WAY TO BE OF SERVICE TO OTHERS I walked into the waiting room of the dental office and took my place on the couch, waiting for my appointment TIME magazine had a lead article about the interrogation process for the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. My appointment was for a routine teeth cleaning and then a longer session to rebuild a tooth. While waiting, I had read far enough into the article to see that the detainees were facing difficult and painful interrogations if they did not provide information quickly. I have very sensitive teeth and therefore am not fond of dental appointments. Even though I respect and like my dentist, I\u2019m always glad when the dental task is concluded. I decided to approach this appointment differently. Both the Guantanamo detainee and I were facing some pain. However, my pain was incredibly minimal compared to the torture he was facing. In my case, I was given"}
{"id": "defining_moments_98", "text": "a topical anesthetic, a buzzing sensation to hide the Novocain as it was inserted through a needle to numb my tooth, accompanied by kind, gentle, thoughtful care that was going to improve my health. In contrast, the detainee was being mistreated with malice, hate, and total lack of concern for his welfare other than not to break the rules of the Geneva Convention too badly. His situation was so much worse than mine, that my appointment, in my own mind became pleasant rather than painful. My only problem was that it didn\u2019t seem fair. However, a solution for the unfairness made me feel better. Sitting there for some three hours doing nothing but holding still, I discovered that I could feel more useful by sending my universal energy, or chi, to someone somewhere who was being abused or tortured in some painful way. It was the same energy my clients give and receive from others over the years in ways that made a formidable difference in their recovery from loss and illness. It was the vibration energy that told me the exact moment a beloved aunt died three thousand miles away. It was a similar force that made thirty Great Danes in an animal shelter move into total silence while they watched me grapple with a strong but painful insight about my family. A similar force tells a cat or dog the exact moment their master is turning around to return home from wherever he may be, whether he is near or thousands of miles away. I held on to that action for much of my visit in the dental chair, trusting that the universe would somehow convey my gift precisely where it needed to go, leaving plenty of energy for me to make my way back to my own office for work. My morning went quickly; and perhaps somewhere, some place, someone else in pain because of abuse felt a little more peace or a little stronger because of my actions. Maybe their abuse stopped. Now that would be a miracle. I was tired when I left, but it was a good tired. I\u2019ll remember what I did, and use it again for any uncomfortable medical procedure in the future. I can share it with any readers who believe that sharing energy can help others. Those who are afraid of going to the dentist might come up with the courage because they can meaningfully distract themselves by imagining a difference in this positive way. Perhaps we can impact a current world that is in need of miracles, compassion and caring every day to combat the actions that plunder people and nature upon our planet. 43 WHATEVER HAPPENED TO RIGHT AND WRONG? By the time I decided to write this manuscript, I had been seeing clients for 41 years. There has been one major change that has been disturbing to me over this time. It has crept up on all of us in subtle and not so subtle ways. When"}
{"id": "defining_moments_99", "text": "I was a child in the 1950s, I was taught that some things were just plain wrong. Doing something wrong usually involved hurting someone else. There were also many ways to do things right. There was a clear differentiation between the two that was not to be argued. When I did something wrong, there was no talking myself or anyone else out of it. However, there was often something I could do to make it right. The clients who have come to see me over the years seem to have the same sense of right and wrong. They raise concerns with me that some of the people they are interfacing with are operating out of the notion, \u201cThe end justifies the means,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all right to do anything I want as long as I don\u2019t get caught,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that I can get away with not getting caught... so ... let\u2019s give it a try.\u201d Any discussion appears to generate dismissive phrases as, \u201cWhatever . . . \u201d \u201cDuhhhh . . . \u201d or \u201cSo what.\u201d This is especially true for clients that work administratively in the corporate world. Much of this growing attitude seems to come out of making an initial success. Then the good fortune is maintained indefinitely by sliding into unethical behavior that begins to hurt other people. For instance, I hear about the specialist in autism that has a two-year waiting list, requires $750 up front for an hour visit with a follow-up interview at the same price. He does not take insurance. There is no sliding scale fee for lower income parents because the specialist knows that parents will spend everything they can to help their child. If he sees five parents a day ... you do the math ... more than one million in profit over two years. On top of it all, the treatment provided may become so routine that the professional may become arrogant or sloppy at best. The parents stand to PAY $1500 after waiting two years, while nobody cares. These parents of autistic children, who cannot afford these fees, come into my office aghast and completely defeated. And there is a question about whether the professional is really doing anything wrong? Because others are doing it too ... After all \u201cIt\u2019s the professional standard of care.\u201d A potential success meant for everyone becomes a devastating event for all those but the rich who can afford it. When there was a clearer sense of right and wrong, I believe that people showed a greater sense of compassion for others, a higher sense of morality and thus benefited from an increased integrity. Integrity is defined in Webster\u2019s dictionary as \"\u2018the quality or state of being of sound moral principle; uprightness, honesty and sincerity.\u201d These are words that rarely show up in our current daily conversations. Greed has become a lousy substitute for taking care of each other well. In my office, there is a clear sense of right and"}
{"id": "defining_moments_100", "text": "wrong. It\u2019s absolutely not all right to come up with any plan that will purposefully harm, demean, or mislead someone else. I help clients to understand that acting with integrity is richly rewarded with a sense of peace, and satisfaction. When there is integrity, everyone wins. Self-esteem, respect, and confidence come from our ability to do well in our interactions with others. As inherently social beings we need helpful interaction with each other. Clients who behave unethically often acquire a lot of money or material things, but they rarely seem to be happy or peaceful. They act so self-assured and arrogant that the outside world often turns a blind eye to trying to stop them until they have done incredible damage. The devastation they create for others doesn\u2019t help them become happier. It is a total waste of hurt. The wealthy client and I start over from square one, rebuilding an empty, angry, impoverished internal psychic world that has become devoid of love, compassion and meaning. It is unnerving to discover that our attitude of \u201cdo anything you want as long as you don\u2019t get caught\u201d has crept all the way to the top of the corporate world, real estate, and even to the White House. We spend billions on destroying others with war out of greed and self importance, while 20,000 people die each day around the world because they are lacking basic necessities. Such behavior sets a very scary example for our youth who are looking to people with prominent lives as models. Unethical behavior creates lack of trust, accompanied by a profound sense of loneliness. My clients are scared, and rightfully so. They may try to talk themselves into grabbing for what they can get as a terribly poor substitute for compassionately caring for each other. I observe that the animal kingdom and the environment shudder as they perceive mankind to be dishonest with each other and the universe as a whole. The Native Americans believe that the natural calamities that have increased markedly in number during the past years are the universe\u2019s way of telling us that we are doing wrong. If we don\u2019t correct our dishonest ways, can the universe muster enough force to take humans off the planet altogether? Would global warming accomplish the task? Would our world then become a better place? Deepak Chopra in The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams speaks about \u201cego-based power that is false,\u201d and \u201cself power that is permanent.\u201d If you have a certain title\u2014if you are the president of the country or the chairman of a corporation\u2014 or if you have a lot of money, the power you enjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money.

I could tell immediately that he had bad news. He shuffled back and forth with a resigned unhappiness. \u201cI just thought you might want to know,\u201d he said, \u201cThe sixty-year old apartment building across the street has been sold and the wonderful new owners have arrived. They\u2019ve told everybody in the building that there can no longer be any plants in pots by their door or anywhere around the building. The manager is allowed to water, but only occasionally. Got to keep the water bill down. The new owners are going to individually rewire all of the units so that everyone now has to pay for their own utilities. I suppose that\u2019s the crude way of getting around rent control. This will effectively raise their rent maybe as much as one third. I just thought you might like to know.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d I muttered under my breath to soften the anger I felt. He continued, \u201cAnd, if that isn\u2019t enough, the less-than-1000-square-foot house I just sold across the street will now be rented for $3500 a month. The 400-square-foot unit over the garage is being offered for $1700 ... can you believe? That\u2019s over twice the amount of the rent I charged! This time I spoke up, \u201cDamn ... all in the same day!\u201d Don drove the nail into the coffin by summing it all up. \u201cThere goes our little street into the hands of the wealthy who don\u2019t care if they take advantage of the population unable to own a home. I suppose they\u2019ve finally reached our street.\u201d He hopped into his car and took off to run some errands. I sensed his anger by the screeching of his brakes at the bottom of the hill. Something on the street had substantially shifted. I walked up the steep sidewalk slowly to the \u201cjust sold\u201d apartment building, absorbing this news and feeling sorrow about the likely obvious changes for the worse, especially for the elder tenants within the apartment building. Our family has lived on this street for twenty five years. Don has served in the capacity of a local uncle for my daughter, watching her grow from a jump-roping child to a pregnant woman, listening to her life stories, and giving her wise counsel. My office overlooks his home, so I\u2019ve watched his place for him while I\u2019m talking on the telephone, enough to safely catch the dog that escaped out the door when the repair man came. My husband and Don have done many projects together to clean up the neighborhood, repair damage to nature, and keep it safe for everyone. We\u2019ve always helped each other. We talk together on the street corner, watching the"}

Coincidently, a friend had just sent me a quote from Haile Selassie by e-mail: Throughout history, it has been the inaction of those who could have acted; the indifference of those who should have known better, the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most that has made it possible for evil to triumph. With Selassie\u2019s message ringing in my ears, there was only one thing I could think to do about this impending change. I knocked on the door of the apartment manager. He answered quickly. I reviewed the news I had just heard from Don, and then added, \u201cI know that there are some kind older people who have been here a long time. I know that their plants are important to them. If there is anyone who has to remove a favorite or special outdoor plant that has been growing for a long period of time, please tell them that I would be glad to take the plant into my shady driveway. They could see it from their window, go on taking care of it, and visit it any time they want. I have some garden space, and would also help them plant anything they wish in my garden.\u201d The manager seemed touched and replied, \u201cThank you so much for stopping by to tell me. Right now we\u2019re not moving any plants, because I believe people have a right to have them. However, if we\u2019re forced into getting rid of them, I\u2019ll tell people what you\u2019ve said.\u201d I wished that there was something more I could do. Will any exceptions be made for people on a limited income? How many people will have to leave because they can\u2019t afford their utilities? Where will they go in this outrageously expensive city? Will anyone become homeless? Will evil triumph on this street slowly and silently? I didn\u2019t know how to fight back and didn\u2019t think anyone would understand if I did. The deeper and deeper divide that\u2019s occurring between the wealthy and the poor leaves me very concerned. I can see it now. The building may begin to look run down with dried foliage around it and no potted plant life. Conflict and resentment within its walls may spill out to make an unhappy atmosphere. Instead the new owners could improve the place, bringing in more content and happy people. They could even feel good about what they did in a deeper way than they would ever have by making a lot of money. Perhaps then, they might not need so much money. Who knows? Could their obvious improvements and compassion earn them even more money? 45 DEAR CEO/CFO To: CEOs and CFOs of Large Corporations Date: February 22, 2002 From: A Psychotherapist and Human Beings Sharing This Earth.

Therefore, I was especially dismayed to hear about the Enron Scandal because the behavior of those involved sets a bad precedent for all of us. I find it as disturbing as September 11, 2001, because Enron also destroyed the lives of so many families, especially retirees on fixed incomes who were left with nothing. I am a clinical psychologist, and I have been in private practice for over twenty-three years. I have seen the CEO who comes into my office dressed to \u201cimpress.\u201d I've watched him sit down and blurt out, \u201cWhy do I always want a little more? The man with the most toys doesn\u2019t win,\u201d and sob his heart out. We start from there to build a new life that has positive meaning well beyond the wealth he has ever acquired. I see a man who has millions on the outside but far too little depth or riches on the inside of his soul to sustain a positive sense of self. This is because he has bankrupted himself by breaking promises, lying, and knowingly hurting others to benefit himself financially. I\u2019ve seen many clients who work for corporations. They assure me that what went on in Enron is \u201cStandard practice\u201d ... \u201cNothing new\u201d ... \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time.\u201d They feel discouraged from doing well or showing any loyalty to their company because it would be way too devastating if the result was being laid off in under half an hour. Gone, computer locked up, no party, no goodbye, no appreciation, no bonus, no severance, just vacation time left, no letter of reference giving credit for any work well done. Just unadulterated loss for the employee and ... more money for somebody at the top. Every crisis is a danger and an opportunity. It\u2019s a chance to build a new and better life for all of us. If we all look the other way and let Enron take the Fifth Amendment, we then silently endorse such unethical and criminal behavior. Our standard of morality will slip another major notch; sowing fertile ground for enraged terrorists and a plundered planet. Most CEOs and CFOs don\u2019t seem to know that something is wrong, so they rarely show up for psychotherapy. However, I have helped some CEOs over the years to rebuild their lives.

We, too, will become more ethical and honest with each other. Our world will become a safer place. We will thank you and you will feel joy. Sincerely, 46 A MIDDLEPERSON BETWEEN LOW INCOME AND THE WEALTHY An artist, needing to make some extra money, took a job in which she \u201cmanaged\u201d a large number of unemployed people who were temporarily hired as catering waiters to provide the \u201cset up\u201d and \u201ctake down\u201d for a wine tasting and restaurant sampling event over three days in a wealthy city. The hired temporary workers were given a flat fee per day before they knew that each day lasted from early morning to late night resulting in very little sleep and with pay that was way under minimum wage. They needed to lug wine glasses, wine bottles and food up two flights from a garage below. Each of the three summer days were very hot. Some of them were compromised by heat stroke, dehydration and blisters on their feet. Understandably, they were frustrated and angry, but not daring to take a stand or decline because of an overwhelming need to generate an income. Upstairs, the persons who attended this event bought $150.00 tickets and walked on the same stairs as the workers, seemingly without noticing the strain the workers were under. It was a beautiful example of the widening gap between the rich and the poor. Our recent census tells us that the United States now has the widest gap between the wealthy and the low income of any industrialized nation. Shame on us. However, this manager/actress positioned herself right in the middle between the workers and the event coordinator. She talked with the workers who were getting exhausted, and also talked with the wealthy people who were likely making a handsome profit from this event. She negotiated with the rich to give the workers a bonus, and allow each worker to invite friends to enter this event on the last day for free. The very next day, I learned of a very intelligent middle aged actor who had suffered from a stroke and cancer. He had rehabilitated"}

Due to the recession, and loss of rent, he was unable to continue his full mortgage payments. The bank had already sold the building out from under him without informing him. He could not file a \u201chardship letter\u201d for refinancing because his property was an \u201cInvestment.\u201d The bank had no interest in his situation. In this case, there was no middle man to speak up for him. Finally, there is the city of Bell within Greater Los Angeles with City Managers and staff making unbelievable huge salaries because they financially abused a low income community with unreasonable taxes and parking tickets. There was no middleman to even begin to understand the number of decisions that were terribly wrong. However, the City Managers have been arrested, and additional communities within the same area are in the process of being assessed and exposed. We are all here together, yet, when it comes to the wealthy understanding the low income and the poor understanding the rich, it feels like there is no contact and no common ground or language. Of course, there are exceptions, carefully articulated in Bill Clintons\u2019 book entitled Giving, How Each One of Us Can Change the World. Clinton has carefully researched the for profit companies who are giving to third world countries, and making significant and critical contributions to those in need. Microsoft is a prime example. And, there are countless nonprofit companies who are also addressing those in need. I can see from the many hours I have spent within the privacy of psychotherapy sessions, that both the wealthy and the financially limited appear to have differing strengths and vulnerabilities. The rich are strong at making money, but seem to put all of their eggs in one basket; striving to look shiny and wealthy on the outside. However, sometimes this coping hides an impoverished internal self, and self-esteem that is lacking in meaningful life goals, concerns, and compassion for others. The poor are often resourceful, resilient, compassionate and persistent at \u201cmaking ends meet\u201d when the going is really difficult. As increasing global issues threaten our planet and require our unanimous corrections; both the rich and the less wealthy need, more than ever, to be able to be in respectful contact with each other. I propose that we create an advanced Master level or Doctoral degree that is related to study of psychology that would train qualified persons to serve in the capacity of \u201cMiddleperson\u201d positioned as the actress/manager was equidistant between the wealthy and the poor. Federal and State government would require these positions within each department, and for profit organizations would make sure \u201cMiddleperson\u201d attended all board decision making meetings. This would be important for four reasons: 1. Those with lower income would be treated in a manner that would give them an increased chance of surviving. 2. Those with many material things would have a chance to be informed, make decisions"}

All businesses would have an increased chance of flourishing because more people would have some income to spend. 4.

When each one of us dies and there is a Funeral or Memorial Service, the subject at hand is not what the deceased acquired in material things, but how this person lived life, researched, learned, shared, noticed and participated in helping people, animals and the environment. 47 IT IS TIME TO GIVE ARTISTS A CHANCE TO CHANGE THE WORLD Richard Bolles said it well in The Job Hunter\u2019s Survival Guide; How to Find Hope and Rewarding Work Even When There Are No Jobs. How did this world get into the economic mess it\u2019s currently in? Well, to speak in glittering generalities, far too many of us, (both individuals and nations) spent too much, borrowed too much, lived too high, saved too little, invested with too much risk, and played a Ponzi scheme with nature. When all of this came crashing down, the consequences affected not just ourselves, but others around the world ... You end up with all of us in the same boat. And now what any of us decides to do has consequences for others and not just ourselves ... If I default on my mortgage, it lowers the value of my neighbors\u2019 homes, (page ix) \u201cCapitalism\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d should never mean getting whatever you want for yourself with no regard for the negative impact it may have on others. I hope that we can learn from the Recession, starting in 2008, that we must replace greed with compassion, generosity, and integrity in a way that markedly reduces the ever widening gap between the rich and the poor. My clients have reminded me that greed does not make anyone happy; it only drives each person to aggressively leap for more. Compassion and integrity teach us that we can only be truly happy when we can create and reside in a world where everyone has, at least, the basics. Giving brings more peace, happiness, and contentment than receiving and makes the world safer for all of us. The overall goal towards contentment is achieved through the absence of needless suffering for any person. Relationships are about sharing, within a healthy competitive motivation rather than a greedy survival of the richest. Volunteering brings forth depth and meaning. We can only maintain and truly enjoy nature and the beauty of our earth if we contribute to take care of the planet together. We have tried to regulate the world with religious beliefs, but fighting over which doctrine is the best has caused more death from religious wars than nature\u2019s natural disasters.

We have elected politicians to run out nations, but they find themselves quickly in a conflict of interest because they have to limit themselves to voting for what will get them financial support on the right committees to be reelected. The movie, In the Loop, is an excellent example of this problem. We have allowed cities, states and nations to go into horrendous debt. We then argue and bail ourselves out by turning a blind eye while cutting services to the poor, disabled, youth, prisoners, and elderly in need for the sake of preserving the bonuses and golden parachutes at the top of our corporations and governments. According to the Los Angeles Times, (July 31, 2009) nine banks took 175 billion in taxpayer bailout aid and then rewarded 32 billion of it to pay 5,000 bonuses of a million or more to employers who created and maintained a broken system. As a culture, we have dismissed our artists as \u201cstruggling\u201d and \u201cstarving\u201d out of feelings of threat and jealousy. Therefore, we have not considered artists as a powerful independent resource with ideas for the leaders of the cities, states, and nations. Artists solve problems for the collective good of all of us with ideas about the preservation of a rich planet and the best of our cultural heritage. Why should we give artists a try? Denise Shekerjian interviewed forty artists who were winners of the MacArthur Foundation Award. She then wrote a book published in 1990 entitled Uncommon Genius. How Great Ideas Are Born. She describes many aspects of the Creative Impulse. Some are direct quotes from the artists she interviewed.

Many artists have now received their award. With a seven billion dollar budget, the MacArthur Foundation has also been able to fund many social projects in the United States and around the world that promote equality. Several artists are now serving within United States Cabinet positions. This culture needs to understand that artists can make a significant contribution to the problems within this nation. Would the current president\u2019s administration be willing to invite the MacArthur Foundation to gather some of its interested artists to come together to look at the financial, health, equality and environmental problems we are trying to solve at the present time? Would their input give us new ways to tackle the challenging issues of today? What would happen if artists and corporate leaders began to talk? Could that ever happen? Both might benefit from learning unknown skills and expertise from each other. Could the present administration restrict bailout funds for bonuses within the corporate world. Instead, more funds would be allocated to remove our artists from the \u201cstarving\u201d and \u201cstruggling\u201d ranks so that they could also continue to speak out individually and collectively. 48 A PLAN TO RETURN A SENSE OF COMMUNITY, PURPOSE AND MEANING FOR SIXTEEN MILLION UNEMPLOYED During this long recession and many natural disasters, I am one of the lucky ones who has been"}

However, my sense of accomplishment has been eroded by the sadness I feel for the sixteen million US citizens who are currently unemployed. It has become evident that the longer they are without work, the harder their chances are of finding a job. I am sure, they are a powerful group as a whole, with many different kinds of expertise to offer a flailing nation. Many of us still working are missing their presence. Having a job gives most of us much more than a badly needed income. Employment gives us a place to go every day, a structure, a purpose, a sense of satisfaction that the world may be a better place because of what we have contributed. Work should give us a chance to interact with honesty and integrity. Doing well in the workplace helps us to define our expertise, maintain a decent self-esteem, feel confidence and belonging within a community. I wonder how many of the unemployed are home alone, feeling restless and badly about themselves as well as their circumstances? What are they doing to fill their time? I\u2019d hate to be in their shoes. How many are slipping inadvertently into depression with substance abuse or other dysfunctional behaviors? I see their despair in my office \u201cup close and personal.\u201d Much of my work revolves around helping those suddenly unemployed to rediscover their lost dreams and latent talents through self-employment. This way they can\u2019t be laid off ... ever again. My sadness is the fodder for my creativity ... allowing the following idea to emerge. We may not be able to start with salaries for our unemployed right away, but could we, together, create a plan to give the unemployed the other important advantages outlined above regarding going to work? I am suggesting that the President of the United States would give a series of speeches to the nation to explain clearly a plan that would motivate National, state, and local governments to rally together to offer meeting places for the unemployed across the country. This should be coordinated to take place at the same time. Organizations interested in volunteer and financial help would send representatives to analyze talents and interests of the unemployed. Taking advantage of their findings, the unemployed would restart some of the many projects that have been abandoned because of cutbacks across the country. The talents of the unemployed, already developed from years of working, could be utilized to restore these services. This plan also provides a place to go, meaningful activity, and a sense of community for those unemployed. Such projects might include: \u2022 care for the elderly \u2022 restore services that have been cut out of educational programs \u2022 assist teachers with crowded classrooms tutor children with special needs \u2022 create after school programs for latch key kids for families working long hours \u2022 maintain those foreclosed homes"}
{"id": "defining_moments_110", "text": "that can be rescued, and demolish the rest \u2022 plant community gardens for those short on food \u2022 cleanup litter on the same days across the entire country \u2022 teach low cost classes to generate creativity, and encourage artists to speak out \u2022 continue low-cost community clinics for mental, physical health, and urgent care \u2022 keep open and maintain parks for recreation \u2022 provide training for prisoners in overcrowded jails \u2022 combat Global Warming with green projects, and environmental care \u2022 conduct legal investigation into Corporations blatantly contributing to home foreclosures and unemployment \u2022 take care of pets abandoned due to foreclosures Those who are employed would each contribute financially to grants with a \u201cvoluntary assessment\u201d that would be completely separate from \u201ctaxes.\u201d Those working in business could lend equipment, technology and consultation. As projects became organized and successful, the unemployed could gather together and apply for grants to continue. They would then be able to pay for expenses and draw a salary for themselves. The President could run his second term Presidential campaign by going to visit the many projects that will get started throughout the country. He could use some of his millions in campaign funds to pay for travel, televise and award grant money from voluntary assessment for projects getting underway. Since this plan would be part of his campaign, and the \u201cvoluntary assessments\u201d from working citizens are in place of taxes; there should be no need to put it through Congress for approval, where it would likely get easily derailed. Might the rich decide to \u201cdonate\u201d instead of \u201cbeing taxed?\u201d The President would have concrete successful improvements to demonstrate on television, in place of costly TV political demeaning advertisements, to enable his reelection. Those in need, those unemployed, and those working, would all have a part in the task of rebuilding a nation by restoring equality for the basic necessities of living safely and comfortably within the United States. 49 I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF... BIG SUNDAY happened last weekend in Los Angeles. This event started ten years ago with thirty people who decided to volunteer, donate expertise, and materials to non-profit organizations and schools for one day. Ten years later, 50,000 people have become involved and the event now encompasses two days. Volunteer workers have bonded with some of the nonprofit projects and returned during the year to maintain the work they\u2019ve initiated. The givers and receivers have both benefited from the exchange. I wonder what would happen if we were able to accomplish the same result with another important issue? With modern technology, we are now able to reach around the globe very quickly to everywhere except the most remote villages. What if we were to start with one day a year when everyone in the world would refrain from doing any violence of any sort? This would mean that war would stop, suicide bombers would desist, parents would not abuse their children, siblings would not squabble, gang members would not shoot anyone,"}
{"id": "defining_moments_111", "text": "robbers would not break into homes and stores, and couples would not engage in domestic violence. Road rage would stop. No one would be raped, murdered, or sexually abused on that day. Everyone would be fairly warned long ahead of time as to the date and time. Everyone would be ready. Police would have a relaxed, boring day because so much aggression would come to a halt. The naysayers would chime in quickly, \u201cWhat if some group took advantage of the situation?\u201d If the rest of the world cooperated, they would lose support for whatever damage they did very fast. Police and military would stay on alert. If we were able to accomplish this for one day, then we could try for two days per year, or one day every six months. If that worked, we could try one day every three months. Perhaps we could work our way to one day every month. What would such a day be like? As a therapist, I\u2019ve listened and treated clients with so many stories of aggression and abuse. We\u2019ve never seen the world without human aggression. Could we unlock our doors, feel the quiet of no police sirens, and walk down the street at night without being on alert for trouble? In place of being aggressive, we could relax our guard against aggression from others. Instead we might become moved to substitute an act of compassion for someone else, an animal, or the environment. Compassion is the opposite of violence. No violence and billions of acts of kindness all on one day could change the world forever. We could see how we feel without aggression. Would nature reduce violence through hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, volcanoes, tornadoes, heat waves, and droughts on those same days? Would the universe quietly rejoice with beautiful sunrises and sunsets, gorgeous days, and blooming flowers? Want to try it? Aren\u2019t you curious?. Who will come forward to start organizing it? Let me know what you think and what you\u2019re willing to do. I\u2019ll help. You bet I will. 50 AS A PSYCHOTHERAPIST, I WISH THAT... Everyone in the world would agree to do three kind, loving, and helpful acts for someone else, an animal, a bird, plant or the environment each week. These acts would be above and beyond anything each one of us does in the normal course of a day. Such acts of help do not need to involve money, so that everyone could participate in some way. Every religion, and culture knows what an act of kindness is. Therefore, we don\u2019t need to disagree. What would happen if the radio and television reported people\u2019s kind actions and what needs to be done instead of the murders and acts of violence that get on the news each day? Let\u2019s calculate. There would be trillions of acts of kindness each week. Would that number be enough to overwhelm the acts of violence so much that aggressive acts would reduce in number because they would lose their appeal?"}

There would not be so much stress, sorrow, physical illness, mental disorder, death, destruction, and post-traumatic stress. Instead, we might begin to see joy, hope, and gratitude in a much expanded way, not only from the people who receive the acts of kindness, but from the persons who give the acts of kindness. There really is no better way to feel joy and build self-esteem. We would feel more creative and encouraged to come up with new good acts of compassion. We are all so stymied by the multiple problems in the world each one of us feels that there is little we, as individuals, can do about it. So we trudge onward, taking what we can for ourselves, donating our own small part, often wishing we could make a larger mark on the troubles of the world. This is such a simple idea, but with such large positive ramifications in so many areas of life. Would we ever be able to coordinate with each other around the world enough to give it a try? Just for one whole year? Could we use the United Nations and the internet to spread the idea from one country to another? We could do the necessary research to look at the results. The outcome might just be staggering. Is there any viable reason not to give it a try? V DEFINING MOMENTS FOR CHILDREN 51 ANXIETY HELPS I was skiing with my father in the mountain resort of Stowe, Vermont. It was a cold and windy day, leaving me frozen even though I was fully dressed in a snowsuit, scarf, hat and gloves. I was nine and growing fast. The sleeves of my jacket were getting too short, so the cold snow could slide down my arms. I turned my face towards the sun, trying to break through clouds, for warmth. We made it down an easy \u201cbunny\u201d slope three times without falling. It had a rope tow to haul me back up the hill. I was feeling a new sense of confidence and control, becoming more graceful on skis. Dad and I went to the coffee shop for a hot chocolate and a chance to warm up. As my hands and toes thawed, they tingled just the way my arm does when I fall asleep on it while reading a book. My Dad doesn\u2019t talk much. He\u2019s a smart doctor, but a very reserved man. He works many hours a week, doing stuff I can\u2019t understand. I\u2019m a little scared of him. My mother makes him take me skiing; so I can\u2019t tell if he really likes to go with me. He talks more easily about science than about feelings. I was thinking and thinking about asking him if he thought I was old enough to ride the chairlift so that I could go all the way up"}

We walked over to the single line for the chairlift. There were about fifteen people waiting to get on. I adjusted to the cold again, hoping for the sun to keep me company on my new solo journey to the top of the mountain. I noticed that the single chairlift came around the corner to pick up each person very fast. I began to get nervous. It looked hard to get in the right place with poles and skis on, and then catch the chair as it came rushing by. What if I fell? What if I didn\u2019t get on? Would the man stop the chairlift? Now I was scared. Did that mean I was not ready? I told my Dad, \u201cThat chair is going so fast.\u201d \u201cNot too fast.\u201d \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t get on?\u201d \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d \u201cYes\u201d What he said next really surprised me because he so rarely talked about feelings. \u201cGood for you. It\u2019s good to feel anxious when you\u2019re doing something for the first time. Being nervous makes you careful. It makes you check things out so that you don\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d \u201cWill you ask the man to slow the chair lift down for me since it\u2019s the first time?\u201d I wondered out loud. \u201cNo, since you\u2019re anxious I already know that you\u2019ll be careful, and you\u2019ll do a good job. I\u2019ll be on the chair right behind you.\u201d Now there were only three people ahead of me. It was getting too late to say \u2018NO!\u2019 I watched how the people in front of me did it. One of them was a kid just a little bigger than me. First, put your head through the hole in a big blanket to keep you warm. Put both poles in the left hand. Line your skis up straight ahead. Turn around and watch the chair coming to swoop you up. Grab the metal pole that holds the chair. Sit down and close the gate in front of you. My Dad watched. I was anxious. Being nervous made me do it right. Dad winked. The man slowed the chair just a very little bit. How did he know? I did it! For the first time, I could see out to all of the trails as the chair carried me up the mountain. It was so cold that I had to put the blanket over my face. When we got to the top, my Dad rubbed my cheeks to make sure I did not get frostbite. We sided down to the bottom. I followed him. He fell two times."}

They\u2019re able to stand back and watch to see who their kid really is. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the child is an athlete, academic, dancer, poet, boxer, blue collar worker, scientist, learning disabled, genius, autistic, or musician. Generally, they are able to support the child\u2019s physical, psychological and spiritual growth in a way that allows for the full development of a unique individual. If their child is experiencing difficulty in some area of life, they can speak about it openly and seek consultation that will be of help. The child\u2019s problem does little to embarrass the parent or reduce the feeling of love. Instead, the relationship deepens as the problem is addressed, improved and accepted. Parents learn from their children\u2019s strengths and vulnerabilities when they are different from their own. In teaching their children, these parents are able to expose themselves, sharing their own vulnerabilities and life story complete with its mistakes and triumphs. These parents also have their own lives to lead, their own successes and vulnerabilities to master, and ways to measure their own self- esteem that are independent from their child\u2019s performance. In my office, I\u2019m hearing a lot about another group of parents who raise what I have come to call \u201cReport Card\u201d or \u201cTrophy\u201d Children. These children are inadvertently or directly given the job of holding up their parents\u2019 flagging self-esteem. The child\u2019s actions are always seen by the parents as an indication or a report card of how well the parents are parenting. Therefore, the child has to act in a manner that proves to the world that the parent is indeed a good parent. The child has to become the kind of grown up that the parent wants the child to be. If the child steps out of line, the parent becomes extremely anxious. They handle this anxiety by becoming rigidly over-controlling, manipulative or punishing. Some use guilt or financial reward to shape their children\u2019s behavior. Others over-protect the child\u2019s image by saying that the child can do no wrong. These children \u201cwalk on water.\u201d In a word, the parents desperately need the child to behave in a certain way to support their self-esteem as parents, rather than loving the child and watching to see how that child may uniquely develop. Children who resist this kind of parenting may well face an enormous power struggle that is impossible to win and sometimes results in parental abuse. These children have to bury their own unique selves in order to comply. They tend to be extremely focused on what others want them to do. They know the right"}

If she drifts off or her attention wanders, Dad will start reading aloud to her. She is not allowed to date until she turns thirty. She will become an MD.

Instead they\u2019re quick to pull their children out of therapy if they sense that the child is in need of and moving towards more autonomy. Somehow many of these children make it to adulthood and come into therapy alone when they are old enough to pay for it themselves. The client and I go back and find the interests of the lost child, and grow her up again to become the person she was supposed to be. Parents of Report Card Children generally don\u2019t understand that they\u2019ve failed to develop their own positive sense of self. Bolstering self-esteem may prove difficult when the job of parenting gives little validation, no pay, and some isolation for stay-at-home- parents. Parents bolster their own self-esteem through their children. The better alternative is for the parents to help the child develop the child\u2019s strengths and interests. In this manner the child\u2019s self-esteem is built and consequently, so is that of the parents. Parenting is the hardest job on the planet; yet there is no required training to become a parent. Therefore, the pendulum swings widely back and forth as we try to correct for what we feel went wrong within our own childhoods. Society could reduce the number of Report Card children and adults in need of psychotherapy if educational institutions offered required parenting courses. 53 DEFEATING BULLIES WITHOUT GETTING INTO TROUBLE \u201cHey you, what do you think you\u2019re doing!?\u201d Todd almost tripped as he struggled to run fast in his low-slung, wide-legged pants draped over awkward boots. A police car had just parked on the street. The policeman caught up with him and grabbed him by the shoulder so that he had to stop. Todd gulped air to catch his breath. The policeman was panting too. \u201cWhy are you running ..."}

Slow down.\u201d The lump in Todd\u2019s throat was too big for him to swallow as his mind flashed on the last time he was beaten by his Dad. The policeman knelt down so their eyes were level with each other and then said very quietly, \u201cWant to tell me why you got suspended?\u201d \u201cA boy tripped me in PE, so ... I slugged him. I got suspended; he didn\u2019t. I\u2019m new at the school. He\u2019s been there a long time.

While we\u2019re walking, I can tell you some of the ways I used to cope with bullies when I was a kid.\u201d \u201cSure, man, go ahead, but I\u2019ll bet no one bullied you, you\u2019re a policeman.\u201d \u201cOh yeah, they did bully me - I wasn\u2019t a policeman then.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 I can do.\u201d \u201cDid you know that a bully is someone who feels bad about himself?\u201d \u201cNah, they\u2019re the tough guys.\u201d \u201cNooooo ... they\u2019re pretending to be tough guys. Underneath, they\u2019re having a bad day.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cYeah, try it and you\u2019ll see. Ask them, as they show the first sign of bugging you, \u2018Are you having a bad day? Want to talk about it?\u2019 Sometimes they will. In any case, the question usually stops them in their tracks just long enough for you to slip away. They can\u2019t believe that you\u2019ve asked.\u201d Todd stopped crying and was listening intently. \u201cWould Dad be having a bad day when he hits me?\u201d \u201cGood thinking. It\u2019s always a bad day for a parent when a kid gets kicked out of school.\u201d The policeman had shortened his gait so that it matched that of the boy.

Both of us did not have enough money to buy lunch at school. Both of us missed our dads. Both of us were scared, and wanted to act tough and express our feelings of frustration with a fight. Both of us got suspended.\u201d \u201cWow. Who taught you this stuff?\u201d \u201cMy grandfather did. He was a policeman, too. He learned it in his training program.\u201d Todd and the policeman walked on in silence, respecting each other. They were approaching Todd\u2019s small parochial alternative school. \u201cWell, we\u2019re here. How about we go in and I\u2019ll talk with the principal. I\u2019ll tell him that I found you on the street. I\u2019ll also tell him that I have already talked with you about how to handle a bully and you listened up really well. I\u2019ll recommend that you go back to the classroom. If he doesn\u2019t agree, then I\u2019ll call your parents and make sure that your dad doesn\u2019t beat you. That\u2019s against the law. He\u2019ll listen to me.\u201d \u201cThanks ... so much. Are you a dad? I mean, do you have kids of your own?\u201d \u201cYes, I do. I have a boy your age. He\u2019s been bullied, too. I tell him the same things. It works for him. It should work for you.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s lucky.\u201d \u201cAnd remember, if your Dad wants to beat you, ask him, Are you having a bad day?\u2019 Then tell him, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m making you have a bad day.

A policeman told me that it\u2019s against the law for you to beat me.\u2019 \u201d \u201cOk.\u201d Todd and the policeman just had time to finish their conversation before they were face to face with the principal. \u201cI found this boy running away from your school.\u201d The policeman suddenly sounded official. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve suspended him.\u201d interrupted the principal with an"}

You better show me what you learned if there\u2019s trouble next time.\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Todd stood up straight. The policeman winked, squeezed Todd on the shoulder, and slipped out the door saying too quietly for anyone else to hear but Todd, \u201cI\u2019ll just bet I\u2019ll never see you running down this street again. Go for it.\u201d Todd\u2019s eyes filled with tears, so he ducked his head, brushed his face with his hand, then straightened up as tall as he could and lumbered shyly back to his classroom. Four days later, the principal was walking through the school yard. He noticed a crowd of children and two teachers. He went over to see what was going on. Todd sat on top of a kid the principal knew well to be a bully. Todd\u2019s hands pinned the bully\u2019s wrists. There was no fight to break up. As the principal reached the circle of onlookers, Todd got up and brushed himself off. The bully rose more slowly, stunned. Todd touched the bully\u2019s shoulder briefly but respectfully. Then Todd held his head high and walked right toward the principal. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the principal asked as the small crowd dispersed. \u201cJust doin\u2019 like the policeman taught me.\u201d Todd muttered under his breath. 54 HOW TO HELP MORE DIFFICULT CHILDREN I attended a seminar by Robert Brooks from Harvard that was entitled, Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or Learning Difficulties: Strategies for Building Motivation, Self-Esteem, Hope and Resilience. Dr. Brooks spoke of his personal journey through 30 years of work with these children. He has a son, now in his thirties, with learning difficulties. He feels that he almost lost his relationship with his son because he would come in the door every night and the first words out of his mouth were \u201cHave you done your homework?\u201d For four years, this child did no homework. Now his son is designing and maintaining Dr. Brooks\u2019 website (www.drrobertbrooks. com). Dr. Brooks spoke for six hours. I pass on to my clients the following points that were very useful from his seminar: It is an obvious fact, but we often forget that children are born different. Within three months after birth, they fit into one of three categories. The Easy Child: These children act in ways that say, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you look like a great parent.\u201d They are truly easy children"}
{"id": "defining_moments_119", "text": "to raise. The parents of these kids have a lot of good advice for the parents of the other two kinds of kids. The Slow-to-Warm-Up Child: These children are born shy, but with support become more outgoing by the age of 12. The Difficult Child: These children feel that life is not fair. They see the world as not providing adequately for them. Some of them have Learning Difficulties (LD) and/or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). They tend to be insatiable, wanting to \u201csuck you dry\u201d leaving you feeling like an inadequate parent. They may be hypersensitive to touch and to noise. They often experience you as yelling when you are not. A towel can feel like sandpaper to them. They lack organization and consistency in their behavior. Brooks advised us, \u201cNever judge a parent unless you have walked in their shoes.\u201d There are terrific parents out there not evident from their kids\u2019 behaviors. Few people understand just how worried these children are about being loved and being successful when they grow up. They don\u2019t feel intelligent. Their self-esteem is extremely low. They don\u2019t like compliments because they don\u2019t believe in them. They often believe that the praise they receive is manipulative to force a certain behavior, and is therefore false. Many of these kids have lost hope. They say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use.\u201d The feelings of loneliness are very profound, especially when they have finished their formal education. We cannot expect these children to change unless we\u2019re willing to change the way we treat them. It does not help to punish, reject, isolate, or take away the activities in which they are interested and do well. These kids have three basic needs: \u2022 The need to belong, to feel connected, to feel welcome \u2022 The need for self-determination \u2022 The need to feel competent Many difficult kids are doing well in other areas of their lives. Therefore, these children often display conflicting beliefs about themselves. Each child assesses both their special talents and difficulties as Carol Wren and Jay Eihorn express in Hanging By a Twig: Understanding and Counseling Adults with Learning Disabilities and ADD . : \u201cI want it/ I fear it\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself /I\u2019m ashamed\u201d \u201cI feel confident in myself /I have no confidence.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m smart /I\u2019m dumb\u201d \u201cI\u2019m lazy /I\u2019m trying as hard as I can\u201d \u201cI\u2019m rational /I\u2019m losing my mind\u201d Be sure to help your child recognize and build on their strengths so that they can feel competent. Focus on their skills. Therefore, speak of your child as not a \u201cLD child\u201d but a \u201cchild with LD .\u201d Never say, \u201cTry harder.\u201d or \u201c If you did another hour of work, life would be all right.\u201d Difficult kids hear this all the time from parents and teachers. There is no test for trying harder. We don\u2019t know what it is like to walk in their shoes. We do not know if they are not trying as hard as they can. Instead say, \u201cI"}

Do not try to discuss something while your kid is arguing with you. Try not to say what you don\u2019t want said to you. If you get frustrated, you can take a \u201ctime out\u201d instead of the child. In your darkest moments, try to keep your sense of humor. Empathy is a key feeling that works well with these children, and all children in general. It is \u201cthe capacity to put yourself inside of someone else\u2019s shoes and see the world through their eyes.\u201d It is not sympathy or feeling sorry for them. Therefore, it\u2019s important to ask these kids just how they see you at the moment. Have them draw, write, or give you a description so you can see your relationship with them through their eyes. Empathy means saying, \u201cI know that what you are trying to do is not easy. It is not easy for a lot of kids. Maybe we can figure out a way to handle this together. It gets easier over time.\u201d If you wish to tell a child something, preface it with: \u201cI have something to say to you. If you feel criticized, will you please tell me?\u201d When they tell you something, say, \u201cThank you so much for letting me know.\u201d When interacting with these kids, ask yourself, \u201cHow can I say this so that we both problem-solve?\u201d Is what I\u2019m doing going to develop hope in this child? Being fair is not treating these kids the same way as other kids. Being fair is giving them what they need. Children love to help and to make a difference, and come up with a solution. Give these kids choices. \u201cYou can choose to do three out of six problems.\u201d However, it is always wise to have a backup plan that will aid in being successful. These kids have some excellent ideas. When they come up with a good idea, tell them, \u201cThat was a great idea! Can I share it with others?\u201d Fifteen hundred difficult kids reported their most positive memories of school. Their memories involved being noticed or recognized or being asked to help out. The most negative memories involved public humiliation for not understanding. Our schools need to provide a curriculum for caring in addition to academics. These children have learned not to have a good day because it will be held against them for the rest of their lives. For example, parents and teachers have said, \u201cYou were able to do it last week, why can\u2019t you do it now?\u201d Instead, focus on what they were able to do to make it a good day. The most important key to success for a difficult child is to have \u201cone person who stood by this child and believed in him/her or a charismatic person from whom this child gathers strength.\u201d Try consciously to minimize the fear of"}

My seven year old daughter, Kendall, was holding my hand tightly. Kendall is an adoptee. Because she had been relinquished by the two people who were supposed to love and take care of her, she never seemed completely sure that I would not relinquish her also. Therefore, when traveling, she made sure to never let go of my hand during a long trip. My words did nothing to reassure her. My deep love for her was apparently never quite enough to quell the attachment trauma within her heart of losing her birth parents at birth. She did not trust the words \u201cI love you.\u201d Her life experience had already told her love likely meant, \u201cPlease go away.\u201d Therefore, it appeared scary for her to say \u201cI love you\u201d to me. Sometimes I became weary or impatient about her need for reassurance. It had been hard for me to fully understand until, on this day, I looked up at the airport monitors to locate the gate and the plane that would take us both back to Los Angeles. We had been visiting an aunt and uncle who had stepped into the role of grandparents for my daughter. We had a great time. The monitor showed the flights that were going to Burlington, Vermont. That is where my parents live. They had disinherited me because I had written and published another book that they hated. There was no contact with them by phone, letter or direct meeting. I had not heard from them for six months. I felt a deep pain. Suddenly, I could begin to feel what it is like to be an adoptee in a closed adoption because I had a biological family \u201cout there,\u201d but I was no longer invited and I did not"}
{"id": "defining_moments_122", "text": "\u201cbelong.\u201d Finally, I got it. As the tears silently ran down my face, I understood, at gut level, what it felt like to be Kendall. Hallelujah! ... not intellectually the way the books on adoption gave it to me, but at a wrenching feeling level. I could understand why my daughter was so difficult to please during the holidays. There was a family out there who had relinquished her and was celebrating without her. No other family can really substitute. It didn\u2019t matter how hard my husband and I tried to meet her needs; it\u2019s just not the same. I could begin to forgive myself for never being the right parent for my daughter, and understand better why she reacted the way she did. I looked down at Kendall. She was gazing somewhere else and did not notice that I was crying. I knelt down and put my arm around her shoulder, located where to board the plane for Los Angeles, stood up again, and started walking with her while holding hands, towards the gate. There was no way to tell her, at her young age, what I had just learned. 56 WHEN \u201cI LOVE YOU\u201d MEANS \u201cPLEASE GO AWAY\u201d Anne, an adult adoptee, and I had been working in psychotherapy together for a few months. She started her hour with me abruptly. \u201cI was looking at my birth certificate and discovered that my name was spelled wrong, although who knows what the wrong spelling is anyway. It\u2019s only wrong if I think I know who I am ... when I was a child, I used to stare into the mirror for hours, and I never knew why. Perhaps I was trying to figure out who I was. It was confusing because I knew I was adopted, but everyone said I had the body type of my adoptive mother and I acted like my adopted father. Of course, I can\u2019t really know who I am because I don\u2019t know my birth father. I also have two different names for him on my birth certificate. One of them is listed in our local phone book.\u201d \u201cWhat you describe sounds very difficult.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you something else. I hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy, but I hate the words \u2018I love you.\u2019 \u201d \u201cDo you know why?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely. My adoptive mother always told me that my birth mother loved me, but she couldn\u2019t take care of me.\u201d \u201cWhat did that mean to you?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really simple. My life story tells me that if someone \u2018loves you,\u2019 that means they \u2018give you away.\u2019 Who in the hell wants that? Whenever I hear \u2018I love you.\u2019 it makes me really uncomfortable.\u201d \u201cNow I understand ... Did your adoptive Mom and Dad say \u2018I love you\u2019?\u201d \u201cYup, they did and I liked it, but they\u2019re not the same as me, even though they\u2019re relatives in my extended family. So \u2018I love you\u2019 from them means \u2018mismatch.\u2019 That makes me uncomfortable in a different way."}
{"id": "defining_moments_123", "text": "I can\u2019t look to them to see who I am.\u201d Anne paused in thought for a few minutes. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing to say. I think that I\u2019ll only feel safe within my family when I have my own child. Then I can say and hear \u2018I love you\u2019 without feeling uncomfortable. I want to get married and have a family more than anything else in the world. But it\u2019s hard, because it scares me to hear \u2018I love you\u2019 from a date. I just want to run away. So ... how can I ever get married to have a child?\u201d \u201cI hope that it\u2019s helpful for you to talk about this with someone. You\u2019ve really helped me to understand. It makes good sense to me. Perhaps your understanding about what you\u2019ve discovered will make it easier for you to dare to fall in love.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right, I would never have gotten so far with my new relationship if I\u2019d not been able to talk with you this way ... Perhaps that\u2019s why I treat life so casually. Sometimes, I take risks I shouldn\u2019t ... it\u2019s as if I don\u2019t care if I do die ... maybe it\u2019s because life feels not much fun without love in it somewhere, where it does feel comfortable.\u201d I wished she could see herself through my eyes. Therefore, I ventured, \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful, thoughtful person. You deserve to be loved and to love without fear. You and I are working on that issue until we get there. Remember you are adult now and will never be \u201crelinquished\u201d again. That word is for children who need a home. Your birth mother placed you because she was afraid that she could not manage to take care of you. It wasn\u2019t because she didn\u2019t like you.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting there. I feel different after we talk about it.\u201d Later that day, I spoke with another adoptee on the telephone. She\u2019d married and had adopted two children. She\u2019s a good friend, so I asked her how she felt about hearing the phrase, \u201cI love you.\u201d She responded immediately the same way Anne did, as if she\u2019d overheard our psychotherapy dialogue. \u201cOh, that means \u2018please go away.\u2019 \u201d The next morning, my adopted daughter, Kendall, came home after one week in the hospital after an emergency C-section to deliver her baby five weeks early. The baby was still in the hospital. Kendall had created the new family with matching genes that Anne longed to have so she could feel love safely for the first time. When Kendall arrived, she walked into the nursery and missed her baby terribly. I\u2019d missed Kendall while she was in the hospital, and had cleaned the house and put up a welcome sign. However, Kendall felt no joy at her homecoming. In addition to missing her baby, she probably could only feel the disappointment of our natural ongoing genetic mismatch. She was rude to me as she tried to cope with her pain. I could"}

Her frantic adoptive mother was wondering why her adoptee was not focusing on the court hearing.

Then the boyfriend suddenly and unexpectedly announced that he would be \u201cmoving to Philadelphia across the country to find himself.\u201d He had abruptly departed two days later. I asked my client, \u201cHow do you feel about his departure?\u201d Angie responded, \u201cI feel abandoned ... cold, sad and worthless.\u201d We talked for some time about Angie\u2019s life story. I learned that she was adopted. Her birth mother was a graduate student and \u201cneeded to leave the country to go on a fellowship to Japan to find her career.\u201d Her birth father entered the military. She was relinquished to a \u201creally nice adoptive couple, and had a good childhood.\u201d School went well. She has talent as an artist. She\u2019d taken some community college classes and worked as a preschool teacher. As her story unfolded, I began to understand why she was likely having anxiety and panic attacks. Towards the end of the hour, I explained to her, \u201cDo you see a parallel between your story thirty years ago, and the relationship you just lost?\u201d \u201cOhhhhhhh,\u201d Angie responded. She shifted position abruptly. \u201cI wonder if you\u2019re having the feelings that you had when you were a baby, just born. Your birth mother probably had to leave you at the hospital, and you were alone until you reached your adoptive family.\u201d \u201cOh, noooo.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I suggested. \u201cYou suddenly lost everything you knew about your birth mother ... the music she listened to, the T V programs she watched, the food she ate, the position"}

Both your birth mother and your boyfriend left you to \u201cfind themselves.\u201d \u201cBut why would I feel so worthless. My parents told me that I was \u2018special.\u2019 They had \u2018chosen\u2019 me and brought me home. They picked me over other kids. They love me.\u201d \u201cIndeed, you are \u2018special\u2019 to them. However, when you are an adoptee, unfortunately you have to be \u2018unchosen\u2019 before you can become \u2018chosen.\u2019 \u201d \u201cI see ... sort of.\u201d \u201cYour infant brain was very young. It takes thirty years for all of the brain to reach full maturity. Your infant brain could only see that grownups are \u2018all powerful and all perfect.\u2019 Therefore, if anything goes wrong, it is unquestionably the infant\u2019s fault.\u201d \u201cI feel as if the breakup with my boyfriend is all my fault now, too.\u201d \u201cWell, if I were in your shoes, I would feel terribly confused.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause, your infant brain says \u2018relinquishment was all your fault\u2019 while your adoptive parents say your were \u2018special\u2019 and \u2018chosen.\u2019 Which is right?\u201d Angie engaged with me while moving to the edge of her chair. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I feel so uneasy, I flip back and forth between the two contradictory feelings. I thought being \u2018special\u2019 made me better than other kids. But I was also \u2018abandoned\u2019 by the one person who was supposed to love me.\u201d \u201cPerhaps those are the feelings that made you feel panicky enough to call me today.\u201d \u201cYeah, the voice of panic confirms I\u2019ve been left and I deserve it ... I guess it was also hard to feel that my adoptive family brought me \u201chome\u201d because I grew up in a family where no one was like me in any way ... I just didn\u2019t fit in ... Nothing was the same, not the voice, the eyes, they way we laughed. It was all so different. I couldn\u2019t be like them even when I tried. Boy, did I try.\u201d \u201cDid you feel that your difference made you feel \u2018less than\u2019 the rest of your adoptive family?\u201d \u201cYes ... and I couldn\u2019t really get a handle on who I was because I had no information from my biological family. I wanted to be like them, but I didn\u2019t know who they were.\u201d \u201cAre you saying that it\u2019s hard to value and love yourself when you don\u2019t know who you are?\u201d \u201cAnd that makes it my fault that my boyfriend left town. He couldn\u2019t see who I was ... because even I didn\u2019t know. So it is all my fault ... get it? Obviously, he didn\u2019t love me.\u201d \u201cIt must be so hard to have those feelings. Have you considered that perhaps your boyfriend had some problems of his own that made it hard for him to make a commitment to someone he loved?\u201d \u201cNooooo ...

She\u2019s so loud and constant it makes me crazy and keeps me up at night. \u201d \u201cThis time we can make it different. You also have a grownup part of you that called me up and understands that you have made a life for yourself that you can honor and respect. This grown up part can begin to calm the little infant.\u201d \u201cWhat can I say to the baby?\u201d \u201cYou can tell your baby that your relinquishment was not her fault. You see ... I have never met a birth mother who wanted to give up her baby or thought something was wrong with her baby. Every birth mother I\u2019ve met is afraid that they won\u2019t be able to be a good enough parent, and that an adoptive couple can do a better job. A birth mother doesn\u2019t have a clue as to how psychologically hard it will be for you, the birth father, her and the adoptive family. Birth mothers grieve the loss of their child every year for about thirty years. Many of them report thinking about their relinquished child every day.\u201d \u201cYeah ... that\u2019s what my birth mother said when I finally met her two years ago. I could hardly believe it ... But, the infant still says, \u2018It\u2019s my fault.\u2019 \u201d \u201cWell the infant is wrong. Relinquishment is never the infant\u2019s fault.\u201d Angie sat quietly for a time absorbing what we had said. I could see her body begin to relax. Tears of pain and relief slowly rolled down her cheeks. \u201cSo, if you like, you and I might need to meet together for a while to decide what to do with all of these contradictory feelings. We need to decide which are the ones that are going to take you through the rest of your life.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to feel as if it were all right for me to want and deserve love, a home, and a family of my very own. I hope I can believe that someday.\u201d \u201cBelieving it has a lot to do with its actually happening. I can see that you have many fine qualities. Perhaps it will be both disappointing and relieving for me to say that you are neither \u201cspecial\u201d nor \u201cworthless.\u201d Instead, you\u2019re a person with your own unique strengths and vulnerabilities, like all the rest of us. You\u2019re equal to those who are not adopted. You will come to know and appreciate who you are as we talk this through.\u201d \u201cWell, I feel tired now ... but thank you so much for making sense of what\u2019s going on in my head.

You should also know that your feelings are normal and shared by all of the adoptees I\u2019ve counseled. Your feelings are not crazy, but are natural to your unique life experience of adoption. Next time you come in for your appointment, perhaps I can begin to learn more about your adoptive and birth families.\u201d \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a lot to say. They were good people even though they were different from me.

Maybe something is not quite right with your child. Your little boy is not progressing the way your friends\u2019 children are. While you notice the difference out loud, your friends are strangely quiet. I encourage you. \u201cYes, it\u2019s time to have your child evaluated by a specialist. It\u2019s time to make the call.\u201d The news brings contradictory feelings flooding your mind. You\u2019re relieved, on the one hand, that there\u2019s a reason why things don\u2019t feel right. At the same time, you\u2019re devastated. Suddenly you have to acquire knowledge about something for which you may know little or nothing. What did you do wrong to make this happen? Is there something you can do to fix it? And, you don\u2019t want your child to see how confused you feel. But how do you hide these feelings without pretending to an absurd degree? Maybe the diagnosis is Birth Trauma, Down\u2019s Syndrome, or Spina Bifida, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), Learning Difficulty (LD), Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, Autism, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, genetic addiction genes, perhaps combined with Highly Sensitive Person (HSP), physical or medical problem such as Mitro Valve Prolapse, Diabetes, or Cancer. Perhaps your child is a foster or an adoptee with a traumatic history. Many adoptees frequently have learning difficulties and ADD. I listen carefully, give you support and a chance to express your emerging feelings. You will see that there are three kinds of children out there. The first kind of child is easy. Easy children are born with a good gene package; they mostly raise themselves. Their parents feel pride in their successful parenting. The second kind of child is shy. They may cling to parents, needing extra support, but usually outgrow their shyness by the age of twelve. The third kind of child is a difficult child with special needs. They require extraordinary parenting and the right kind of genuine support. The love that develops is important and deep. You go to bed and cry quietly. You begin to feel"}
{"id": "defining_moments_128", "text": "the first twinges of aloneness, as if you\u2019re stepping into a foreign land, and no current friend has learned the language that you\u2019ll have to learn to speak. You have only two choices. If you have plenty of money, you may choose to handle your situation by hiring full time nannies to do everything your child needs but can\u2019t do for himself. You can find tutors, and after school programs to manage homework. Both turn the child\u2019s special needs over for training outside of the family. Or You can enter the world of extraordinary parenting. You will mentor your special needs child while your special needs child will simultaneously become your mentor. You\u2019ll learn facts you thought you never needed to know. Your sense of humility will grow tremendously, while any arrogant or demeaning attitude you may have had fades as you begin to see the world through your child\u2019s eyes. You will step out of your own narrower easier space to broaden your horizons. You will come to understand that the diagnosis is not your fault. There may be confusion and conflict in your marriage if one parent wants the Nanny and the other one wants to do extraordinary parenting. I can encourage some marital counseling to assign responsibility, reach a compromise, or decide which way to proceed. As you go out into the world with your child, you will interact with all of the people who don\u2019t comprehend. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to remember that they lack understanding just as you did before the diagnosis for your child arrived. Parents of easy kids may stare at you and your child in public places. From their perspective, they\u2019re wondering what\u2019s going wrong and why on earth you\u2019re not able to fix it. They may even look annoyed. They do not have the information or experience to respond differently. Their parenting is much easier than yours; they believe you\u2019re doing something wrong, while they know how to do it right. Their children walk away with the awards in school assemblies, while you and your family have earned none for your extraordinary efforts. Parents of kids without special needs have no idea what kind of support you need for you and your child. Therefore, you\u2019re on your own until you find a friend who is able to understand and may silently give support. You have to hold up your own and your family\u2019s self-esteem. Validation from the outside world is rare. However, I can help you to see yourself clearly and respect the honest efforts you\u2019ve made. Perhaps you have holiday celebrations with friends who have children. Your child may not behave in an acceptable manner because of his special difficulty or related psychological feelings. You may have to take a \u201ctime out\u201d from the gathering, or leave the party early.

I will encourage you to seek new friends who also have challenging children. They will become your best friends because they already understand. They\u2019re able to listen. They will support you because they\u2019re on the same journey with their children. They may replace some of the parents of easier children, because they\u2019re seeking the same depth in living life that you are. They\u2019re the ones to understand the days that are heartbreaking, wonderful and frustrating beyond belief. Look carefully, because your child may have special needs, but is also likely to be very talented in some area of living life. Nurture and support her talent, letting it flower in a way that carries her out into the world, in spite of other difficulties. You\u2019ll learn to notice what goes right. There will be magical moments, inconsequential to others, when your child masters some task that has previously been difficult or even impossible. You\u2019ll scream a silent, \u201cYeah.\u201d Notice the depth that your child has acquired in the mastery of her difficulty. Make sure your compliments are genuine validation, and not manipulations to make your child behave in a particular way. Otherwise, your child will come to hate the very compliments we all need to get on with life. There will be days when you\u2019re very discouraged and will perhaps want to give up; but you know that you can\u2019t. You may burn out with a child, who needs to test your limits by doing something bad to see if you\u2019ll kick him out, fail to do what you expect because he simply can\u2019t. He may seek negative attention because it feels louder and stronger than positive attention. You may try to talk with a parent of a child without special needs who may impatiently say, \u201cWhen you decide to stop all of this, your life will change for the better.\u201d They\u2019ll say this because they don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s no way out without abandoning your child. That, you know, is totally unacceptable. Your commitment to this child is ongoing ... as long as it takes ... much longer than is needed for \u2018easy\u2019 and \u2018shy\u2019 children. You\u2019ll be on deck advocating for assessments and special services, and on the lookout for professionals who can really help. Generally, you\u2019ll also have to constantly evaluate that you\u2019re not spoiling, rescuing, or enabling. You strive to reliably articulate positive, narratives of moments when your child did well, rather than criticism, because it\u2019s the only interaction that really helps your child to feel some sense of competence, belonging and self-determination. During these times, I can walk with you as needed through this journey, having made it myself. There will be defining moments in which you realize that mentoring this child has given you a richer gift than you ever thought possible.

Perhaps you will be a candidate to write an article, a book, a script, to serve on a board, start an organization, raise money for a cause, or teach a seminar, sharing who you have become with other parents who can gain from your insights. You have become accustomed to persevering while riding the waves of criticism. Your life will not be easy but it will have been worthwhile. That counts for a lot. Your child may never be able to tell you how much she loves the help and belief in her that you have given. Instead, she believes in her relationship with you enough to show you her most discouraged feelings. She stays connected and tells you what\u2019s important in her life. I have seen parents of special needs children walk into my office devastated by a diagnosis and muster the courage to go ahead with a love that\u2019s passionate, dramatic at times, and deep. These parents discover the unique inescapable beauty of their child no diagnosis can erase. They eventually leave my office, after our work is concluded, with their heads held high, and with a purpose that was totally unknown when they first arrived. I salute you all. You have taught me so much. VI MORE DEFINING MOMENTS WITH NATURE 59 RESOLVE AND STAYING POWER I arrived at a neighborhood party on time. The hostess appeared frazzled but declined my offer to help. She still needed some time to get ready, so I asked permission to wander out onto the back patio. Another guest arrived and I heard our hostess say something about \u201chosing down the patio.\u201d She had \u201csprayed the trees with water and a baby bird might have fallen out of its nest?\u201d The patio was indeed clean, except for one small spot. I thought it was just a dirty leaf. I walked closer to discover that it was instead a tiny bird no more than two inches in height in soft colors of wet gray and brown. She was standing straight and completely still on her tiny feet, underneath a table, looking wet, and utterly alone. I saw what appeared to be a baby humming bird, almost ready to fly The guest and I began a search for the bird\u2019s nest. We were unable to find anything resembling a home for this little creature. We knew that if we touched her feathers with our hands, her mother would later reject the bird. There were cats in the neighborhood and a ten week old puppy inside the house. Therefore, we decided to coax the bird gently onto a folded piece of cardboard without touching it. We moved her to a planter on higher ground more secluded and less in harm\u2019s way. She fluttered her wings briefly, confirming that she was alive and accepting of our help. This tiny bird continued with the same total stillness in the new location."}
{"id": "defining_moments_131", "text": "Her eyes were closed, I couldn\u2019t see her breathe, but she was still standing on tiny legs and feet. The party had started with drinks and appetizers in the living room. An hour passed while dinner was cooking on the grill. We talked together and played with the puppy. Before we sat down to dinner, I wandered out into the garden to check on the bird. She was still in the planter, but had managed to rotate her body so that she was facing in the opposite direction. She was, once again, perfectly still with features that were now beginning to dry out. Dinner was served. I helped to clear the plates in preparation for dessert, so I could sneak out once again from the kitchen to see my little friend. The bird was still there, but this time her beady, intensely black eyes had opened. I could see her blink. After dessert, I did some dishes for the hostess, and thereby earned another chance to slip out of the kitchen to check just one more time before dark. No bird was there in the planter or anywhere around on the ground. I could only imagine that the feathers had dried enough for the bird to fly ... perhaps a maiden voyage. As the sun set, I heard one lone bird singing a joyful song. Was it the mother? Had the bird found its way back to the nest? So much of what we have to do in life requires \u201cstaying power.\u201d This bird attracted my attention because she knew exactly what she had to do to survive, even though she was so very young. Nothing could throw this bird off course. We were able to protect her for a time until she reached her goal of survival. I believe that she succeeded. A suicidal client came for a psychotherapy hour just after I finished writing this essay. I told her about the bird. She came to understand that she had to choose whether to flap her wings helplessly, vulnerable to who might come along to help or hurt her; or stand up by herself, like the little bird, and attract the aid she might need to take flight for the rest of her life. The story of the little bird gave her hope, and a concrete decision to make before the end of the hour. When I have \u201cstaying power,\u201d and a sensitivity to my feelings, I attract help from the universe to achieve my life\u2019s work. Whenever I worry, get lazy, or let someone talk me out of what I still have to do, the bird\u2019s intense blinking black eye comes into my vision from the inside of my soul, urging me to stay on my own individual course ... always onward. 60 BECOMING WELL It was a nasty virus. A tight cough, no fever, but a feeling of lethargy I just wanted to lie quietly and look at the ceiling. It seemed to go on for several"}
{"id": "defining_moments_132", "text": "days. I worked half-days and rested whenever I could. But still, the virus seemed lodged within me. Liquids, protein, extra sleep, immune builders, good music, a great book; cats and dogs curled up by my side; nothing seemed to help. I felt alone, with not enough energy to interact with others. It felt strange because I hadn\u2019t been sick for years. Finally I decided to go outside. The rains had been heavy this year, leaving behind an enormous burst of growth of flowers, succulents, cacti, and a huge variety of weeds. I did not feel strong enough to stand for long. However, I was able to sit in the middle of the flowers to pull some weeds. Sitting made me the same height as the flowers. I could see them vividly because they were so close to me at eye level. The birds I fed every day were chirping constantly. Each weed that came loose felt like a piece of the virus lodged but breaking out of my body. I had found a way to feel connected to the energy of the universe. Being amidst nature, at its own height, made me feel better and not so alone. The virus loosened but still lingered for one more day, forcing me to quiet myself and think more deeply about my life. The virus had decked me for a reason. Nature told me to give more respect and free time to myself, and that I had become burnt out in helping others to get back onto their feet. It told me to ask others for what I needed and trust each one to respond. I did not feel so isolated because I knew that I could go back into my back yard and sit with all that grows so respectfully and courageously. I knew that energy would return me to health. 61 DEPLETION BLOOMS Jason hobbled into the house using a walker, and sank into the warm water of our hot tub hoping that it would erase the constant pain in his lower back and leg. He stayed for only a few minutes because the water was not providing any relief. Angela, his girlfriend, was constantly by his side, taking superb care of him. She had brought their two miniature dogs, now chasing each other around the backyard with an astonishing abandon in marked contrast to Jason\u2019s painful constriction. Angela did not have time to get all the way into the hot tub herself before Jason asked for help in getting out. He slowly edged his way back into our home. I offered him some homemade turkey soup before he left to go back to bed in his apartment. He was hungry so he tried to stay by standing, sitting, and then went to lying down on the couch. I could hear his quiet but audible moan. His only sentence was, \u201cI\u2019d amputate this leg if I could.\u201d Too pained to wait for soup; he was already out the door climbing into"}

Angela drove him home swiftly. My heart reverberated his pain. Jason was suffering from a back injury that had occurred twenty years ago and had never been treated with proper medical care due to lack of family support and insurance. Therefore, he\u2019d handled the pain by taking too many illegal pain medications. However, he had insisted upon going off his pain pills without any medical supervision. On the sixth day, he had a seizure that shook his whole body, making his damaged back much worse. He was in the hospital for nine days, only to be dismissed still in pain. Laid off at the end of a grocery store strike, Jason had no insurance. Reputable physicians would not evaluate him further even when offered payment up front. County hospitals were closing down because of deficit budgets. The wait to see a county physician was eight to ten hours with no place to lie down. Jason\u2019s parents and siblings had cut him off, psychologically and financially because they insisted that he attend a particular drug treatment program. It was obvious that he could not stand, sit, or walk enough to make it to the mandatory daily meetings. We had to fix the pain before he could truly face his addiction. I\u2019d already talked with his family to no avail. The pain had been this way for weeks; yet he was valiantly holding to his commitment to stay away from drugs. It was true that he had \u201cmessed up\u201d with his life and hurt others in the process; but was that an adequate justification to ignore his physical pain? What can I do to help? I cared about what happened to him because his girlfriend was a special person in my life. She was patiently determined not to abandon him. His illness and previous drug addiction had hurt her and us and was now holding back the forward progress she now must make to support him. In an attempt to sort out my feelings, I went walking in the high trails of Griffith Park in the middle of Los Angeles where steep hills create a huge bowl of nature that makes me feel cradled by the universe. Below is the bustling city. For fifteen years, I\u2019ve done some of my most insightful, creative thinking in that location. It\u2019s my time, with three dogs, before the work day begins, to think about how to conduct myself during the day. Therefore, I hesitantly asked the universe for a miracle for Jason and Angela. On the dirt road was a stem with buds for a number of small violet flowers. Someone had probably plucked it and then decided to discard it. I lifted it up. There were eight tiny blossoms and only two of them had come into bloom. The flower was badly dehydrated. The stem was still hydrated enough"}

However, it took another half hour to return, and the flower was further squashed in my hand twice in leashing the dogs. At my house, I cut the stem to half its length, put the flower in water, and wondered what would happen. There was nothing else to do to help except to handle it and speak to it softly. Within two hours the flower began to lift its head. After half a day, it stood straight and tall. The blossoms were still closed except for two. This tiny little flower was sending a message about Jason and Angela. The following day, I came back to my office to see how my little piece of nature was faring. The flower was on the sidewalk outside of my window, once more without water and crushed again. The cleaning lady had thrown it out, believing it was not important. I picked it up and returned it to its vase. Again, it revived. The next morning, five of the remaining blossoms had opened, revealing tiny intricate central stamens in white, yellow, and pale violet. I was happy to be able to help, and content because a miracle of the universe was encapsulated within the flower. I was moved to see that the miracle came in the form of a lesson. I could bring the flower home, give it water, and speak to it encouragingly. That was all; the rest lay in the stem and buds of the flower. It was not my job. Trying to help in any other way would have forced the process of blooming and destroyed the flower. The same miracle of health lies within each one of us, but we cannot command someone else to make it happen. The five remaining blossoms lasted for four days. I searched for this kind of flower in the park for many years. It was nowhere to be seen. Jason\u2019s girlfriend called to say that a chiropractor and an AA sponsor had both offered to help Jason. The chiropractor was willing to see him for free. I could help by talking with Jason, giving him encouragement to endure his pain and do what he could to recover. We visited and talked by telephone. I could also pay for acupuncture. I could only do what I did for the flower. I told Jason about it. Jason reminds me of other flowers in my garden that have broken stems. It\u2019s hard to simply throw them away. Instead, I clip off the dead parts that are draining it of survival, and put the live parts in water. They become flower bouquets for my office. Sometimes they bloom, sometimes they don\u2019t. Our help can be lifesaving; but too much help can kill, even if it is done with the right spirit.

That energy was just waiting there for Jason and his girlfriend to grab it in a way that made them feel better. If they claimed it, they could reach their own new goal, because they wanted it more than any drugs, leaving them with a feeling of accomplishment and confidence. There would be no leftover guilt to drown with the next drug. They could tell others how they helped themselves and have the pleasure of sharing what they decided. They would earn money and not spend it on illegal drugs. People like myself could notice and decide to contribute. I had relearned once again from the flower that I could also take pleasure from being generous and caring, receiving back the biggest gift of all, that of giving. I had to quell the need to do more. Angela and Jason took hold of the energy just as the flower chose to lift its head and open its blossoms. Jason\u2019s girlfriend continued to take care of him, but decided to go back to school so she could find a job that would earn a higher wage. He\u2019s sixty percent better now and can sit up and take steps on his own. When I showed him this essay, he read it and wept. Perhaps he felt heard and supported. That opened the door further to understanding new options. Within six months, my husband was able to acquire, at a cost we could afford, the right eight-hour surgery to fix his back and leg. Jason and Angela gave birth nine months after surgery to a baby girl. Jason got back out into the world as a fitness trainer, with an expertise in helping people with back problems. Their love for this little girl has centered them and far surpasses any lingering wish for drags. Thank you, little flower, for your brave gift to us all. VII CLIENTS SPEAK OUT 62 THIRTEEN WISHES TO REBUILD A NATION from the Clients of a Psychotherapy Practice PREFACE I have listened to the fearful palpitations of the citizens of the United States in the inner sanctum of my private office as each client, whether child, adolescent, adult, or elderly, teaches me about their psychological discomfort, what is missing and what needs to change for their lives to work well. They have taught me about the survival skills that kept them going through life even when they were unable to acquire the support they needed. The psychotherapy process becomes more difficult when I realize that some of my clients\u2019 concerns reach beyond the ability of a single therapist. They\u2019re speaking about societal changes that need to be made. I hear the same themes coming up over and over again until they have carved deep synaptic connections within my brain. Some clients have encouraged me to express their collective feelings by writing"}
{"id": "defining_moments_136", "text": "the final section of this book. Some of these desires are put forth by children without the complex psychological defenses that sometimes mask the truth. Our youngsters are honest in their requests and insistently patient with me until I get it right. I was raised in the 1950s and 1960s in the small university town of Burlington, Vermont. I look back on my childhood longingly because it seemed so simple in contrast to the world my daughter and granddaughter live in now. I know that I\u2019m as guilty as the next older person in not being able to accept what\u2019s happening for the next generation, but I also fear that some aspects of our current lives have gone astray. As a child and adolescent, I lived in the country. Nobody ever locked their cars or their homes. I spent my afternoons after school and weekends skating on the pond in my backyard, skiing on the hills and mountains, sailing a small and larger boat on Lake Champlain, exploring farms and forests, playing card and board games with friends, taking care of my younger brother, working in the garden, reading, playing with the pet duck and family dogs who ran freely throughout the neighborhood. Television did not enter our home until I was in 7th grade. As a teenager, the only responsibilities I had were to be a careful teenager sexually and to drive safely in the snow. There was some alcohol, but no drugs, gangs, graffiti, or drive- by shootings. Life was free of computer games, computer viruses, internet pornography, or term papers to steal and plagiarize off the internet. School was safe, with no metal detector tests and no shootings. I was not afraid to walk the streets at night and I could see the stars, the Milky Way, and the Aurora Borealis. I knew nature intimately. I was comfortable within the world I inhabited. My father worked long hours as a physician and a researcher. My mother was a full- time Mom, regarding her parenting as an honorable profession. She also served her community avidly with volunteer work. She was always in the kitchen when I came home from school ready to serve me something to eat, talk with me about my day, and teach me how to maintain a home. She shopped for clothes with me at an unhurried pace. We had time together to teach me how to become a woman. We all ate dinner as a family in the evening and shared time together on the weekends. We took vacations on the family sailboat when I was not at summer camp. I have been fortunate to be married to the same responsible, kind and honest man for forty-three years. I loved the mixture of working with clients and parenting my daughter. Although my husband and I both worked full time, we were able to replicate my mother\u2019s parenting style by working a staggered work schedule. My office is the second floor of my home where"}
{"id": "defining_moments_137", "text": "I can flexibly organize both my professional work and parenting time on a weekly basis. My commute is, therefore, fifteen steps. My husband and I have had time to spend together with my daughter, dogs, cats and horses. However, even this privileged lifestyle sometimes felt hurried, stressful and overwhelming. I observed my daughter understandably afraid to walk to the grocery store even though we live in a decent city neighborhood. She, too, has found her way to nature with horseback riding. Her talents have kept her outdoors with the discipline and responsibility inherent in the total care of two horses. We did not buy her any computer games. We monitored her use of the TV, computer and internet so that she could gain from its great research benefits but would be shielded from viruses, aggression, addiction and pornography. She often disliked school because it was large, impersonal and unable to meet her more individualized academic needs. In forty-one years of seeing clients, I have witnessed three major societal changes. First, women are having babies in their late thirties instead of their early twenties in order to fit in the time to train and start a career. As the cost of living escalates at an alarming rate, full time moms are disappearing into the workforce. Mothering is no longer regarded by society as the honorable profession it used to be. The super-mom is \u201cin\u201d yet the by-product is often emotional and physical exhaustion. She and her husband are often gone up to fifty-five hours a week to manage the average workweek of forty-seven hours and a half-hour commute each way with only a few weeks of vacation time. Children are farmed out to day care, after school programs, or structured activities they may or may not want. Others are lonely latch-key kids locked in their homes because it\u2019s not safe to go outside. Too many children are cooking their own microwave dinners alone. Many parents return to their house too exhausted to meet their children\u2019s needs for attention. These super-moms are working sixty hours a week to maintain job, parenting and housework. Single parents have an even harder time with a staggering amount to manage. To counteract this problem, new Moms are taking six years off before launching their children in school and then returning to work. However, they appear to be having a hard time getting back into the workplace. The second change is the dramatically increasing amount of aggression and dysfunctional sexuality that children are exposed to on a daily basis through television, computer games and the internet. The third change is a shift in the concept of morality. I remember as a child, a clear sense of right and wrong. Now, morality is \u201canything you want to do as long as you don\u2019t get caught.\u201d If you get caught, then \u201cOh, well\u201d and \u201cwhatever,\u201d is the attitude used to withhold or obliterate evidence to save one\u2019s neck. Large institutions exhibiting corporate greed, and religious organizations covering up sexual"}
{"id": "defining_moments_138", "text": "abuse seem to lead the way in defining this lack of morality. Integrity is a fading concept, thought to slow down the fast-track need to propel oneself up the corporate ladder. American children and adolescents appear to show less respect for parents, mentors and teachers than children in many other countries. Although technology has given us tremendous advantages in communicating with each other and sharing information; life is, at the same time, harder. In the spring 2002, I was astounded to read the following statistics in a Newsletter from Touch the Future. Their article entitled Home Alone America confirms and validates my concerns over the past 30 years. 1. The teen suicide rate has increased three-fold from 1960-1990. The suicide rate rose 27 percent for girls and 71 percent for boys from 1979-1988. 2. There is a marked upswing of behavior problems in children. 3. The number of substantiated cases of sexual abuse rose from 13,000 in 1975 to 130,000 in 1986 4. Between 1965 and the late 1980s the amount of time the average American child spent interacting with a parent dropped by 43 percent from around 30 hours a week to around seventeen. 5. Most estimates of the number of latch-key kids ranges from five to fifteen million. 6. August 19, 2002 data from a national survey of Family Growth shows that 11 percent of girls under the age of fifteen had intercourse. 7. Newsweek (October 7, 2002) states three million teens are depressed. I see children who are both lonely and very confused about what is right and wrong and who is really there to help them grow up. They present themselves to me as angry about this state of affairs. They want me to do something to help. We\u2019ve had this information for nine years. What, collectively, are we doing about it? Most of the time, I can help my clients fulfill their individual needs. However, my job becomes more difficult when my clients\u2019 wishes involve change at the societal level. Here I feel limited. I can validate wishes as they are expressed by my clients, support their good thinking, inform them that others feel the same way, and encourage them to act with integrity to make grassroots changes within their own homes, schools and communities. It is my hope that I can impact these issues in a larger way by passing them on to our society through this book. The following wishes have been completely disguised and generalized to reflect a composite of many clients. I am also aware that there are many ethical, responsible, conscientious, caring individuals who are \u201cout there\u201d in the world doing what they feel is best for themselves, others, and for society with much integrity. Many of these people are truly making a difference in a very definitive and public way. Unfortunately, the news media does not highlight these actions as much as they could. We need to hear about them for the purpose of generating good ideas, feeding compassion,"}
{"id": "defining_moments_139", "text": "and demonstrating integrity. Instead, the news tends to report problems and wrongdoing. My clients and I see the heart of the problem as this: We have stopped taking care of each other as a tribe used to take care of its individual members. We seem to have lost the ability to put the heart back into our interactions with each other. My clients express repeatedly that they are hungry for this lost caring. These issues regularly pop up easily within a psychotherapy hour. Therefore, since we are hungry for a kind of caring we are not receiving, we have slipped into thinking that we are justified in becoming greedy. Somehow it is all right for us to grab whatever we can in terms of money and possessions, even if it means hurting others financially, as in stealing from 401Ks; laying people off, scamming the already disadvantaged, and abusing children sexually or physically. We can do this as long as we don\u2019t get caught. Often, when we do get caught, there is no punishment because those who are supposed to punish us are not responsible themselves. We have lost our trust in authority because of the lack of accountability. Our immorality breeds rage, which is acted out with violent T V programs, aggressive computer games, road rage, and pornography that is damaging, especially to children. Those who watch pornography regularly become addicted to virtual world relationships. This activity appears to lower self-esteem and increases feelings of loneliness, isolation and worthlessness. As a nation, we have the ability to read more deeply the meaning of our rage and loneliness. Instead of acting it out, we can use our negative reactions wisely to direct us to make changes so that we all receive more care, concern and help from each other. In Mary Pipher\u2019s book, The Middle of Everywhere, she describes her interviews with some of the four-and-one-half million refugees who have come to America and lived in Lincoln, Nebraska. She describes how we help these refugees and also make them suffer needlessly. Our refugees who thought they were coming to the land of their dreams, speak of US citizens as: \u201cdismally ignorant about the rest of the world,\u201d \u201chaving an enormous sense of entitlement,\u201d \u201cspoiled children in a world of hurting people.\u201d \u201c take too much for granted.\u201d \u201cborn on third base and think that we have hit triples.\u201d \u201ceveryone has to be some place all of the time.\u201d \u201cnever slow down and talk with someone.\u201d My clients have articulated the following thirteen wishes. Their wishes are many. Stay with your frustration in reading them until you see the suggestions my clients and I have made at the end of this essay. Then, see which one turns your frustration into involvement. HOME WISH ONE: from a ten-year-old boy: \u201cDr. Mac, could you help Mom and Dad about how to be parents? They fight a lot with each other about what to do with me. Mom wants to be nice to me; Dad"}
{"id": "defining_moments_140", "text": "wants to punish me. I don\u2019t think they know how to treat me. Sometimes I wonder if I should just go away \u2018cause if I weren\u2019t around they wouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d I believe that loving parenting and education are the two most important cornerstones of society. Good parenting leads to the development of responsible, honorable young adults. It\u2019s the hardest job on the planet. The only model we have is the parenting we\u2019ve received. Sometimes that\u2019s not a very good model. Since it\u2019s such a formidable job, it would make sense to provide parenting education to everyone who wishes to become a parent. We must offer mandatory courses in high school and/or college that provide basic information regarding child development, attachment and what children need from their parents throughout the process of growing up. Since parents must provide a car seat before an infant can leave the hospital; can we require parents also to have completed a course in parenting and child development? We should train parents in positive, constructive ways to discipline their children. When parents don\u2019t know what to do with their children, sometimes they \u201close it.\u201d These are the times when we need instant information that must be made available through hot lines on the telephones and in chat rooms on the internet. Such support might significantly cut down on child physical and verbal abuse. WISH TWO: from an eight-year-old girl: \u201cI want to play with my parents. I don\u2019t get to see my Mom very much anymore. She\u2019s always working, and when she comes home, she\u2019s mostly too tired to talk with me. She still has to do the laundry and the housework. My Dad gets home late, reads the paper and goes on the internet. They\u2019re exhausted by the weekends so we don\u2019t get to do anything fun any more\u201d or: \u201cDr. Mac, you\u2019ve talked to my teacher. Can you talk with my Mom\u2019s boss?\u201d \u201cWhy? What do you need?\u201d I asked curiously. \u201cWell... you see ... I didn\u2019t do so good the other day in the school play.\u201d Tears began to stream down her cheeks. \u201cI let everybody down. I ran off stage instead of singing my song.\u201d \u201cWhat happened? I remember that you had practiced a lot and knew your part well.\u201d \u201cWell ... you see, I never should have noticed the audience because it looked like everyone had their Mom or Dad there but me. My Mom\u2019s boss wouldn\u2019t let her come to my play even when she said she would bring her work home. I got a lump in my throat that was too big to breathe. I ran off the stage so people would not see me cry. Doesn\u2019t Mom\u2019s boss know that kids need Mom or Dad to be there for a school play in the middle of the day just sometimes?\u201d Could employers give fifty hours a year for parents to take paid time off to do volunteer work in the classroom and be present for our children\u2019s school"}
{"id": "defining_moments_141", "text": "shows, sports, demonstrations, music performances, assemblies and plays? I have seen so many children who were devastated that their parents were unable to leave work to attend these events. Strengthening family time makes happier employees, resulting in less sick time, and thereby builds loyalty within the workplace. Everybody wins. Most of the families within my practice have both parents working very hard earning an income to meet the expenses of living and owning a home. The average commute in Los Angeles is a half-hour each way. Many jobs allow only three weeks of vacation time. We work much longer hours and take less time off than most European nations. Our lunch hours are nonexistent or short while the European nations frequently close down business for two hours each day. Those with a longer commute to afford cheaper housing in outlying areas, and those working in the corporate world, often are away from home longer. Our latch-key kids get lonely. My work with families has taught me that children need up to six hours of parenting time daily to be able to grow up in a psychologically healthy way. The only way to achieve this is for this nation to return to a shorter work week, and establish a staggered work schedule. Then, parents can go to work at different times of the day so that children could be guaranteed at least one parent in the home before they leave for school in the morning and when they come home from school in the afternoon. It seems feasible to create work shifts that go from 6-2, 7-3, 8-4, 9-5 ,10-6 ,11-7 with staff meeting or a longer lunch hour sometime between 11 and 2. There would be wonderful additional benefits. Parents would not have to sneak so much time away from work to call or e-mail their children who are home alone. The commute might take a shorter time since the congestion would be spread out over a ten-hour period of time daily. Road rage would likely be reduced as well. WISH THREE : from a teenage girl: \u201cI don\u2019t want any more technology I just want to have some fun with my parents. I want them not to be so harried. I want to do something that makes us laugh.\u201d and From a mom: \u201cI want our society to stop teaching kids poor behavior through technology. I came home from work and discovered my son was playing a computer game in which he was being taught how to steal a car and murder a lady. Why are we making such games for our kids? How did my kid get a hold of this? How can I stop it? Will you please talk to him? This is just not Ok!\u201d and Another mom: \u201cMy daughter is only seven. She was on the internet looking at a Barbie Doll site. She pressed the wrong key and suddenly porn was on the screen! How can that happen? What can I do to block"}
{"id": "defining_moments_142", "text": "this garbage from getting through to her? Do I have to take the computer away completely? I was so furious, poor kid, she thought I was angry with her! I don\u2019t know enough about computers to know what to do to protect her from porn.\u201d and From a father: \u201cI just learned that my wife\u2019s nephew sexually abused a niece. He\u2019s a very talented, bright boy. At first, we couldn\u2019t imagine why he would want to do something like that. Then we learned that he\u2019s alone much of the afternoon after school and that he has been into pornography. His parents didn\u2019t know because, unfortunately, the computer was unsupervised in his room. The parents of both kids are working together with a therapist to understand what happened.\u201d There are so many ways to develop games for children that teach them to do something useful, to do something well, to acquire mastery in something productive. Games can be created to teach children to skateboard, ride bikes on the streets, go out on a date, build things solidly, and choose the best moral decision. Why are we teaching our children to be thieves, robbers, murderers, and sexual voyeurs? We should be able, as a society, to make the virtual world a safer, richer place for our children? Deep down, our children are fed up with technology as parental substitutes. Many of them are afraid to talk about it. Instead they\u2019re \u201cacting out\u201d about it. That is, they\u2019re doing something that their parents don\u2019t like in the hopes of gaining their attention. Aggressive TV shows, and computer games are ways of experiencing the anger they feel at the lack of parental time. Pornography and chat rooms, where people can pretend to be someone else, become the false virtual world companions at the end of the day. Access to pornography has predisposed some children to sexually molest another member of their extended family. They tell me that they do it because they\u2019re so lonely. They\u2019re missing the experience of playing safely in the neighborhood with other kids. A last resort is gang activity for teens who have little or no time with family. Although the rituals that hold this group together are aggressive, destructive, and dysfunctional; there\u2019s a strong sense of belonging. It\u2019s amazing to me just how persistent the graffiti is on the LA River. Over and over, we paint it out and the gangs deliver more art the very next day. Is there not a strong message here? But it\u2019s written in a language that we can\u2019t easily understand. I believe gang members are pleading for the family time needed to raise responsible children to adulthood. In Mary Pipher\u2019s book The Middle of Everywhere, a Mexican immigrant father saw his son in a T-shirt that said, \u201cMore f. . . . ing blood.\u201d The father said, \u201cAmerica is the best country in the world, the richest, the freest. Why do you make things like this for children?\u201d There are some senior citizen"}
{"id": "defining_moments_143", "text": "groups who are coming together to provide supervision, conversation, tutoring, and transportation to after school activities for children who have parents who cannot return home before six in the evening. For instance In Los Angeles, Deborah Constance, a high school dropout and a victim of childhood abuse, alcoholism, three divorces and cancer, opened A Place Called Home in 1993. This is an after-school residence where children can get a snack, stay away from drugs and get their homework done. By the year 2000, it has grown to 4,800 members. I believe that we could help the super mom by offering employment that can be done at home or during the hours their children are in school. We also need to offer these mothers shared jobs where two mothers assume the responsibility for one full-time job, working out the hours that work best for their children\u2019s schedule. EDUCATION WISH FOUR: from a middle school boy: \u201cI hate school, do I have to go? Please help me tell Mom that I won\u2019t go anymore.\u201d \u201cWhat don\u2019t you like?\u201d \u201cThere are so many kids. The building looks terrible. The teachers don\u2019t really want to teach. We don\u2019t have any books, we don\u2019t get homework some of the time. The teachers don\u2019t know my name. I can get a bathroom pass at the beginning of class and no one notices that I don\u2019t come back. I want to go to a small school where someone cares about me and can help me accomplish something.\u201d and A generally somber, quiet, older female science teacher came for her appointment with me after her first week of teaching middle school in the fall. She had an obvious smile on her face. I asked, \u201cHow are you? How was your first week of school?\u201d She responded, \u201cIt was really great. I have only 26 students in my class. I used to have 35 . It makes such a difference. I have two tables in the back of the room that can now be used for experiments instead of being filled with talking students. I can pick out the trouble makers, and I have already had a chance to talk with them. I couldn\u2019t believe it, but they came up to me at the end of the day and said, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 I will be able to get to know each student well. I\u2019ve already learned all of their names. I hope, hope, hope it stays this way. I\u2019m going to have my best teaching year ever ... but, tell me, why did the trouble makers say \u2018thank you?\u2019 \u201d \u201cYou already know who the potential troublemakers are. They don\u2019t want to be bad. They just think they have to do that to get recognized. You told them you have already recognized them in a positive way. They want to be on your side. You\u2019ve already invited them. Any kid can tell whether they have a good teacher in the first fifteen minutes of class. It sounds like they"}
{"id": "defining_moments_144", "text": "are very relieved that you are a good teacher. It\u2019s really awful to get a bad teacher for the whole year.\u201d \u201cI guess so ... I didn\u2019t dare believe the administrators when they told me that they wanted to have a smaller class size. It makes such a difference.\u201d \u201cIf only all schools could do as well as yours ... a lot of kids would be happier.\u201d Teaching, parenting, and child care are three of our most important jobs on the planet because these jobs are the most influential in creating psychologically healthy, educated, moral citizens. Home provides a foundation while school is the second cornerstone of society. Many children spend more time with their teachers and child care workers than they do with their parents. We can have a strong society if we are willing to educate our child-care workers and teachers well, provide them with colorful, attractive, well stocked schools, and then pay them very well. For some reason, teaching and parenting have fallen out of favor in terms of being \u201chonorable\u201d professions. I\u2019ve met wonderful parents and teachers within my practice who keep on doing their work despite the ongoing fact that their labors often go unrecognized. Since these are two of the hardest jobs, we need to reward those who care for children with our highest respect, encouragement, support, and excellent pay because their job is so challenging and critically important. Then we would be able to fill many of the vacancies in teaching positions within our schools and day care centers. I have seen so many students capable of achieving a high school diploma want to drop out because school was not meeting their most basic needs. As we claim to have a shortage in funds for education, especially in California, we have cut back on the very courses and services that our children need to be able to express their emotional, physical and creative energies. These courses are physical education, where stress can be released through exercise, dance, art, poetry, creative writing, music and drama. These are the classes where emotions can be expressed and understood. Many a suicidal student has been identified, not a moment too soon, through creative writing classes. I have supervised Master and Doctoral level interns who go into the Catholic schools and offer counseling to the students. These students who come in are self-referred (with parental approval) for counseling that is free. My interns\u2019 caseloads fill quickly with students eager to come and return every week for as long as they can. They are hungry for time to talk about their growing up and the problems within the lives of their significant others. In the public schools, most of the counseling has been eliminated, or the caseload is so huge that it\u2019s impossible for student and counselor to get to know each other well. Can we ask collectively to increase this basic service to our students? I believe that there is only one way to make a school safe"}
{"id": "defining_moments_145", "text": "for all of our students and teachers. Metal detectors can only catch a destructive plan that has already been made. The only way we can protect everyone is to meet our children\u2019s needs in a way that lets them know clearly that they are important to us both at home, and at school; and that their educational, social and moral development are a top priority. Then we can reduce the kind of rage that is out of control enough to kill others. I dream about richly-funded day care centers and small elementary schools within larger businesses, universities, banks and corporations so that parents could visit their children during their work day and have time with them in the car during their commute. These larger organizations have the capability of funding rich educational projects in place of giving excessive salaries and \u2018golden parachutes\u2019 to high level corporate leaders. Such a project would be an excellent way to attract and keep qualified employees. Families involved within the school could feel a heightened sense of community because they share both school and work. Families with children of the same age would get to know each other even though the employees may work on different floors, professional levels or departments. WISH FIVE: from a twenty-two-year-old woman, who came into therapy to confront shopping addiction and consequent debt: \u201cI wish that companies with catalogues and stores would stop advertising buying with no payments for six to twelve months. Although this is allegedly presented as a gift, it really hurts us by encouraging us to spend money that we don\u2019t have, to increase our debt load, and not be accountable. This philosophy takes advantage of people who are still figuring out how to handle their finances. We would do better to buy only what we can pay for, avoiding completely high interest payments that I can now see are for the benefit of others.\u201d When I request a financial form be filled out for a reduced fee, I ask each client to list their basic expenses so that we can see what income remains to pay for therapy. Often the credit card debt is very high. They didn\u2019t seem to know that spending money they do not have is not all right. Paying later makes the item they purchased cost much more. CORPORATIONS WISH SIX: from a forty-year-old man: \u201cI wish I worked for a company that appreciated my loyalty and good work, and wanted to give loyalty back to me. I wish that I liked the CEO of my company and that he would talk with me. I deserve job security as long as I continue to do responsible work. I\u2019m afraid all the time that my CEO will find a way to take away my job as a means of making more money for himself.\u201d A neighbor worked for Amtrak.

The employees liked him so much that they wrote him a memo saying that they would work for free to keep Amtrak in operation if necessary. My neighbor\u2019s signature was number 87! I asked him, \u201cWhat was this leader doing to generate this loyalty?\u201d My neighbor responded without hesitation, \u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s honest. Second, and equally important, he\u2019s right there with us. He rides the trains, and asks everyone questions about their work. He seeks our opinion and our help instead of talking down to us. He tells us when he thinks we\u2019re not doing as much as we could. He fired two people who were asleep on the job, and a man who swore during a public meeting. He stays in touch with us in person and in memos. When a memo didn\u2019t come for two weeks, we got worried. He responded right away. We\u2019re beginning to laugh again. The guys on the trains paid for their own tee shirts that say.\u2019We like to ride under the Gunn.\u2019 They show their shirts to him when he rides the trains. I guess you could say we have hope. Hey, I\u2019ll bring you some of the memos so that you can see them for yourself.\u201d Look at what David Gunn achieved within two months through the simple act of caring for his workers. The rewards he gained far exceed the money so many corporate CEOs allegedly earn or steal. He achieved richness on the inside crafted from having a purpose in life that gave satisfaction for others and consequently himself. Unfortunately he was asked to resign after three years. When he refused, he was fired. COMMUNITY WISH SEVEN: from a young woman: \u201cI wish I could come to your office without seeing a single piece of trash. It would make me feel like the people around me cared. How can I ever teach my kids to be neat when the outside world is so messy and dirty?\u201d and A young man arrived a few minutes late slightly out of breath. I asked, \u201cDid you just finish a walk around the lake?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he huffed. \u201cI stopped to pick up about two hundred pieces of newspaper that were blowing away at the intersection down the street. It only took me ten minutes to pick them up after they blew all over the place. Several hundred cars must have passed by me. People were waiting near by at the bus stop. No one offered to help, smiled, or gestured to thank me. They must have noticed me because they did not run over me as I darted across the intersection several times. It was as if what I was"}
{"id": "defining_moments_147", "text": "doing was invisible. No one seemed to care about the mess or the cleanup. I felt so separate and alone. Tell me, am I crazy, or addicted to validation, or do people truly not care anymore?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not crazy in your observation, nor addicted to validation. Sometimes we have to step away from the crowd to do what we think is right, or to make a difference. I respect you for what you did. I drive through that intersection several times a day, and will appreciate that it\u2019s clean, remembering your contribution. \u201d It seems as if everywhere we go there is trash. We fling it out of cars, dump it on the paths where we walk in the park, drop it on the sidewalk as we walk along, or leave it three feet from a trash can in a public place. We dump large items such as sofas and old washing machines on back dirt roads. Why do we insist upon continuing to trash our own universe? It feels like such a blatant statement of anger and not caring about each other. Some states, like Oregon, have come up with effective no litter laws. Everyone participates. In a meeting, the trash is collected in the middle of the table. Everyone helps make the environment a beautiful place. Would it be possible for all of us to agree to do some community service for an hour or two once a week until we have completely cleaned up our neighborhoods? Ideally it would be at the same time each week so that we could socialize as we work together to clean up our world. Communities could designate particular areas with the mutual agreement that the area would stay clean. Our drives and walks would then feel more peaceful, decreasing road rage. We would have a vivid visual sense of supporting each other. At this time, the only people, besides our garbage collectors and park workers, who are actively cleaning up and recycling, are the homeless to earn money for food. In Los Angeles, I see many of them working very hard with grocery carts as their only means of transportation. WISH EIGHT: from a client with a chronic illness: \u201cI want all of us to have an equal amount of universal medical insurance. We would pay some and the government would pay some. I want to be able to choose my doctor and to be able to talk with him/her for more than three minutes. I\u2019d like my doctor to care about me and have some bedside manner like doctors used to in the old days when they made house calls. I want my insurance claims to be accepted promptly rather than denied, lost or thrown away.\u201d and From a middle aged woman: \u201cWhen my lab results came back saying nothing was wrong with me, I was not allowed to talk with my doctor. He\u2019s too busy and doesn\u2019t remember my case. I still had questions to ask. My insurance company"}
{"id": "defining_moments_148", "text": "doesn\u2019t care either.\u201d Medical insurance breeds rage among both clients and fellow clinicians. Their rage comes into the clients\u2019 psychotherapy hours. This anger is about the claims that have been \u201clost,\u201d the call to the company where you can\u2019t ever get through to the person you\u2019ve talked to before, or being put on hold for 45 minutes listening to the same speech over and over about how wonderful the insurance company is. Then there is the call where there is some new reason why coverage can\u2019t be granted after you have filed the claims twice and talked to them eight times. Many clients simply give up while the insurance company gets away with not paying. Many qualified clinicians drop off of panels of \u201cMangled\u201d (instead of managed) Health Care in total frustration, leaving too few doctors to provide the necessary service. I think we all have to admit that we have not been able to solve the health crisis in this nation. I see clients, at reduced fees, who cannot afford to go to a doctor. Routine preventative tests are being passed up as prohibitive. People without insurance will only see a doctor when they feel really ill. Then the cost is astronomically higher and sometimes it is too late to really be of help. The death rate is much higher for people without insurance. No one should have to go without health care. The fees for medications, physician, and psychotherapy visits have all become too high. Clients without insurance in Los Angeles are going across the border to Tijuana where they can see doctors at a reasonable cost, have the time to talk with them, and can receive follow-up calls. The elderly in the northern part of the country are taking bus trips to Canada to get prescriptions filled at a more reasonable price. The AARP Bulletin, September 2002, reported that 12-14 per cent of elderly with insurance and 25-31 percent without insurance cannot afford medicines for congestive heart failure, diabetes, and high blood pressure. With Managed Care Companies trying to manage us out of existence, doctors have lost sight of the notion that our work is to do what is best for the client. We have been forced into a position of looking at our interactions with clients from the vantage point of \u201cWhat can I get out of this for me?\u201d This is not a successful way to approach client care. Other countries are doing a better job with health care. We must take a closer look at what they are doing and see if we can set up a new system that provides equal basic insurance coverage for all of us so that we can get on with the business of providing quality care. If other countries can do it, we can too. WISH NINE: From a frustrated art teacher: \u201cI wish that a portion of the money that goes into defense could be made available to fund the work of qualified creative artists. We need"}
{"id": "defining_moments_149", "text": "to provide funding for both children and adults. Artists speak louder than guns. We are in the unique position of having to do our creative work before we might get paid. Artists are in need of outside funding just to pay our most basic expenses while we work. Artists (musicians, poets, actors, dancers, painters, sculptors, authors, potters, gardeners, script writers) tell us what is beautiful, and what changes need to be made. Artists hear the pulse of the nation and pass it back to each one of us. We cannot afford to go without their guidance.\u201d I have worked with many artists over the years. Most of them worry about being able to pay for their basic expenses. This kind of worry can keep the creative process from unfolding properly. The unstable income artists make erodes a confident self-esteem needed to perform or realize their art. Many of them have reduced this worry, by having a second job that pays the rent, can be done during odd hours, may take little intelligence, keeps them in contact with people, and/or uses their creativity and strength in a different way. This important wish has been elaborated in Section IV Chapter 41 -\u201cArtists and Society\u201d and Chapter 47 -\u201cIt Is Time to Give Artists a Chance to Change the World.\u201d WISH TEN : From a single mom: \u201cI wish I could afford to go out to dinner more often. As a single parent, I\u2019m often tired when I come home from work. I don\u2019t want my children to eat fast food. When I do go out, I find that the food is too expensive for me to afford and there is too much food on my plate. The size of the helping is more than I serve my family of three for dinner. I wish that I could order and pay less for a half or even a quarter portion. Then I could afford it and my children could select a meal of their choice to eat.\u201d Countless numbers of research studies and news photographs demonstrate that a staggering number of Americans are overweight and obese. Our children are gaining weight at an alarming rate and exercising too little. Our latch-key kids who have to stay inside until parents return home, are spending their time on the internet and playing computer games. Only their fingers get exercise. Our restaurants are setting a poor example by presenting a plate that has too much food. Often, I will bring home extra food from a restaurant meal enough for two additional lunches. Restaurants could offer half portions with a simple sticker added to any present menu. Our fast food industry is insufficiently interested in serving food that is conducive to losing weight or unclogging our arteries. Fast food restaurants have even made their way into hospitals and schools. We can now make more informed choices since restaurants are required to list ingredients and the total number of calories for each meal. I was staggered to discover"}
{"id": "defining_moments_150", "text": "that so many meals are over 1500 calories. WISH ELEVEN : From an elderly client.\"My husband has died and my children have relocated to faraway parts of the country. They\u2019re too busy with their own children and their work. I need to find a place to live that has people my age and emergency medical care, should I need it. I\u2019m afraid that there are not enough affordable planned community retirement facilities for all of us who are growing older. We need retirement communities with well-developed resources to connect us with nature, pets, and our communities instead of being shut away to die. I want an organized program where I can work with children who do not have grandparents nearby.\u201d I believe that our elderly deserve our best and kindest care, free from abuse, neglect and with adequate insured medical care. Many of our elderly have a rich wisdom and expertise to share with the rest of our culture. They have the time to be altruistic, volunteer and support community projects. They can be a generous resource for our children when we take care of them well. To nourish constricted lives, our Board and Care Homes for the elderly need to have a rich array of plants, visiting cats and dogs, fish tanks, and rich landscaping that can be viewed from inside windows. WISH TWELVE: From an eight year old boy: \u201cDr. Mac, I gave my allowance to a homeless person today. My Mom said that I shouldn\u2019t because he will probably spend it on cigarettes or booze.\u201d \u201cHow much is your allowance?\u201d \u201cTwo dollars.\u201d \u201cWas there a special reason you decided to give it to him today?\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s raining. I don\u2019t want him to be wet. He doesn\u2019t have the money to rent an apartment, but he could go to the thrift store next door and buy a used umbrella. Maybe his dog could fit underneath it too.\u201d \u201cI see your point. I really appreciate your kind thoughts towards this person. Have you seen him before?\u201d \u201cOh yes, we see him often. Sometimes he\u2019s outside of the grocery store and I bring him a treat for his dog. He always says \u2018Thank you.\u2019 He\u2019s very shy. He doesn\u2019t have shoes, only sandals, but I don\u2019t have enough money to buy them for him. I\u2019m not scared of him. Kids and grownups and dogs should be able to have a home\u201d \u201cYou do a lot of sensible thinking.\u201d Our homeless are a constant source of pain for all of us as they stand on exits to freeways and street corners asking for help. Some of them are truly homeless and others are manipulating us to take an easy buck. Homelessness increased when we dumped psychiatric patients out of our Mental Institutions. We have become accustomed to seeing our homeless instead of providing the resources to help them out. Their requirements for shelter are simple and many often have a useful skill to offer society in return. WISH THIRTEEN: From"}
{"id": "defining_moments_151", "text": "an outraged daughter of an elderly parent: \u201cWe have to stop ripping each other off. We are setting a terrible example for the next generation. I refuse to do it. I feel very discouraged about stopping it. Am I paranoid or something, or do I see it the way it really is?\u201d National Public Radio reported a company that was making calls to the elderly to protect them from scams. The company itself was a scam! A test reported in the Journal of the American Nutritional Association showed that only 16 percent of alternative medicine companies making medications for arthritis actually delivered the medicine they claimed on the label. Our economy has declined in part because equity loans are being advertised and sold to homeowners who are not able to afford them so that the company can earn broker\u2019s fees, despite later foreclosures. As I was making the final corrections to this manuscript, a company that wanted me to purchase their virus control software kept interrupting my work. The virus warning notice they put on my screen was a scam. The ultimate example of our rage is terrorism. This appears to be a blind anger acted out on randomly selected innocent strangers. Terrorism is the end result of our global community that sanctions hurting members of our own tribe. Our wars now extend way beyond the battlefield. We are all soldiers with no training on how to fight back. As a global community, we are perched on the edge of uncertainty as we wonder what to do with terrorism. We are mesmerized by destructive leaders who manage to side-step our every attempt to invite them to deal with the rest of the world squarely. We have responded to terrorism with banners and flags that say \u2018United We Stand.\u201d We, as citizens, have bought the flags and put on the tee shirts but, in my opinion, have taken little action. We can take the opportunity to do so much more than we have done. With the balance between giving and taking lopsided, we worry about what we might not have and have lost sight of what we can generate by giving. The gap widens between those who have and those who don\u2019t. More health clinics are closing, and soup kitchen lines are much longer. During this recession, twenty percent of Californians are receiving some form of welfare. The price of housing is finally beginning to drop. The only way we can close the gap is for the \u201chaves\u201d to give much more to the \u201chave nots.\u201d We can rent an apartment to a tenant at less than the going rate, and offer some of our services pro bono or at lower cost. In the process we forge new relationships of value. As we help each other, we will be more able to utilize laughter, calm, the beauty of nature, caring for people, consistent routines, music, touch, dancing, food and prayer as a means to support growth.

The 9.0 earthquake and generated tsunami rattled over the land treating people, animals, nature, cars, homes and boats as toy match box items to be flung about until completely destroyed."}
{"id": "defining_moments_153", "text": "Well over 10,000 dead, and 190,000 people living in temporary shelters three weeks later. There were aftershocks every day for weeks deepening the PTSD response for everyone. People were working in the nuclear reactors absorbing radiation, giving their lives to save countless others. They were a population of survivors showing unbelievable restraint as they stayed away from looting and vandalizing what little was left. Children are without parents, pets and grandparents; parents are without children and extended family. Will the radiation contamination cause cancer for years to come in those that survived? And ... how about the people in Japan who are old enough to have lived through Hiroshima in the beginning of their lives, and this disaster towards the end of a lifetime. Is it possible to integrate both devastations? How could this happen? I don\u2019t know what other people felt. I personally experienced it as the universe screaming at humanity. \u201cDamn you. You have to do better, with everything ... your deficits, your integrity, your morality, your obesity, your care of the planet, your wars, your settling for incompetence, and your greediness. If you don\u2019t improve, this is just a little example, believe me, of what I can do to take you off the planet completely. Look up and listen, feel, then act.\u201d Those of us in Los Angeles, 5,000 miles away across the ocean, took note that we live in a part of the world where a similar earthquake is way overdo. And ... we have a nuclear power plant 60 miles away that we know is not working properly. How do we handle such a reality? What can we do to care for the people left in Japan? What can we learn from this experience to care for everyone on the planet? How can we come together? What will happen if we don\u2019t? Is it merely accidental that we are responding to this tragedy by turning the bloody violence within Libya into a new war involving many nations? My heart hurts daily for those who are alive in Japan and have lost their loved ones, homes, possessions, assets, and jobs within one short horrible few moments. There must be more we can all do besides give money to the Red Cross. However, we don\u2019t share a common language and every country, and many individual families in the world appear to be struggling with a deficit. My clients have been addressing these questions. We have added one more. What would you do with your life if you could know that a devastating earthquake and tsunami would take you out four years from now? Here are some of the concerns that came up and were addressed in the process of answering this one big question: \u2022 Would I give up now? \u2022 How has my life been? \u2022 Do I experience gratitude about what I have? \u2022 What would I change if I could do my life over? \u2022 What would I want to accomplish within the next"}
{"id": "defining_moments_154", "text": "four years? \u2022 How big are my present problems in the larger scheme of events? \u2022 Have I done anything wrong for which I still need to make amends? \u2022 Do I treat my significant relationships well? \u2022 Do I have aggressive/competitive behaviors I need to curtail? \u2022 Do I take charge of holding up my own self-esteem, or expect others to do it for me? \u2022 Am I bored? If so, what can I do to change it? \u2022 How would I handle an earthquake or tsunami if I was indulging in my addiction (alcohol, drugs). \u2022 Would I be able to take care of myself/ or my family? Am I prepared? \u2022 Do I bother to notice how beautiful the universe is in a way that allows me to reach out to appreciation, new insights and goals? \u2022 Do I help others less fortunate enough with generosity, positive verbal support, donations and/or volunteer work? \u2022 How can I directly contribute to leaving a positive imprint on the planet before I die? If everyone could answer these questions in a positive way, what would happen to the changes needed on this planet? One client, who has power to share energy with others, said, \u201cIf everyone on the planet could put aside our differences, our separateness and our oppositions, stop what they are doing and hold hands together for the same ten minutes, the vibrational energy generated would do much to heal the damage.\u201d If we can\u2019t do that, I still believe that each and every individual\u2019s change in a positive way anywhere does register and make a difference. Many people out there are already doing their job. They know it gives meaning and richness to life. Take a deep breath. I dare you not to miss this opportunity. What will you personally offer? Will the universe notice and offer us a less destructive more peaceful world? Can we bother to find out? 64 WHEN PAIN FROM THE PAST BECOMES A STRENGTH Clients first come into my office to confront a painful circumstance from the past or a knockdown in the present. They can feel hit, hurt, demeaned, rejected, angry, guilty, embarrassed, confused, anxious, panicky, lost and/or ashamed. Their misconceptions fuel these feelings, leaving a sense of discouragement and failure. They may even wonder if they should kill themselves. Their initial hours are often heavy ones. As our work progresses together, clarification of the unresolved issues, and related misconceptions leads to taking charge of life again in a meaningful way. Each hour builds hope. I have the highest respect for the work each client undertakes. Out of the pain, unfolds, like a miracle, \u2022 a foundation of strength, \u2022 a new character that understands both past and future survival, \u2022 a new known purpose in how to lead life, \u2022 and a sense of confidence, security, and protection about how to handle inevitable future knockdowns. They sometimes enter bent over, and leave my office at the end of their last"}

When they have \u201cgot it,\u201d they earn the respect from others because they have a depth of character that recognizes and articulates compassion for others\u2019 adversity. 65 SO HOW DO ALL THESE THOUGHTS ADD UP ANYWAY? Most clients do go on to lead a successful life. It is an awesome responsibility and a privilege to be a human being instead of a mosquito or slug. Our bodies are the most beautiful gift we will ever be given. Deepak Chopra in The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success claims: \u201cA single cell in the human body is doing about six trillion things per second, and it has to know what every other cell is doing a t the same time.\u201d p .71 \u201cThe internal dialogue of every cell in the human body is, \u2018How can I help?\u201d(p.l08) Therefore, it makes ultimate sense to take exquisite care of your mental and physical being regardless of what may have happened to you in the past. If you do so, as a result of reading each chapter, you will inevitably be able to: 1. Achieve a reasonable balance of working, loving, playing, resting and eating. 2. Read signals from your body when medical care may be needed. Check it out promptly. Use regular checkups and preventative care. 3. Exercise and stretch daily to release stress, oxygenate your brain, generate new ideas, burn calories to maintain an ideal weight, and remain limber. 4. Spend time alone in nature with stillness and meditation to discover what you desire and release your goals into the universe. 5. Eat cave man food (fruits, \u201cveggies,\u201d nuts, grains and fish), not heavily processed junk food. 6. Read your negative and positive feelings quickly, and take constructive action if a correction needs to be made. 7. Find a way to talk through any unresolved issues with a therapist or knowledgeable supportive significant other for the purpose of integrating/ resolving any hidden parts of yourself, in place of being condemned to repeat what you do not understand. 8. Resolve the past enough to let it go to \u201cback burner\u201d while you make plans for the future that compensate for whatever you didn\u2019t receive. 9. Love and respect you both for yourself, and to present a model of how you want others to treat you. 10. Believe that you deserve to give and receive intimacy. 11. Allow yourself time with powerful supportive mentors. They will become a memory you can consult with forever. 12. Never put yourself down because it only weakens you. Instead, recognize what you don\u2019t like and change it. Then, forgive yourself and let it go. 13. Acknowledge your strengths and let them work for you in a way that gives you meaning, pleasure, and \u201cmakes a difference\u201d for the planet and/or those who inhabit earth. 14. Forever fight/ignore any fear that whatever goal you want to reach won\u2019t happen. Substitute persistence in place of worry and avoidance. 15. Be honest with yourself and others."}

Apologize or make amends when you hurt someone unintentionally or intentionally. 18. Share any good fortune.

Know that we are not intelligent enough to understand all of the ways of the universe. There never has been, nor will there be a duplicate of you. What happens to you in your unique life story may not make sense for a long time. 20. Expect knockdowns, loss and pain as a necessary and expected part of life instead of demeaning yourself. Use adversities as opportunities to grow, learn new coping and/ or retrieve forgotten dreams. 21. Remember that life does not go on forever. Don\u2019t deny your unknown time of death. Use every day as a gift. 22. Take time to realize what you are thankful for each day. 23. Be alert regarding danger, (such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, drunk drivers, scams) but not preoccupied by it. Instead, make sensible survival plans. 24. . Set reasonable boundaries; instead of trying to control others. 25. Balance use of technology with time in nature.

What changes need to be made? Remember, no one will ever know you as well as you do. Therefore, you are the most qualified to take care of you and you will do the best job. As you set the example of taking care of you well, good people will decide it is worth their while to lend you a helping hand, and the bad guys are more likely to pass you by as too great a risk. Also, when you take care of yourself well, you will then have more to give to others effectively. Don\u2019t just read this list and skip reading the book.

Finally, we can all throw in a handsome dose of GOOD LUCK! 66 MY PERSONAL \"MAKING A DIFFERENCE\" Two final questions remain: What do all of these essays have to say in terms of a central theme? How do I activate the way in which I have chosen, or been assigned the task by the universe, of making a meaningful difference during the time that I have been on this planet? All of these essays have the central theme of understanding and \u201cbeing\u201d in a caring way. My life\u2019s work is invisible in that it takes place in the privacy of my office in a confidentiality that prohibits sharing with others. Clients stay as long as they feel a need and then say \u201cgoodbye,\u201d often never to return. Sometimes, they come back for additional help, call, or send a card, but most often, I don\u2019t get to see what happens to the rest of their lives. I grieve each loss. We are social beings and we all crave compassionate giving, love, validation, honesty, and constructive confrontation with each other. I believe that we slip into greed, abuse, power struggles, materialism, crime, drugs, porn, and scams only when we don\u2019t believe we deserve, or give up on acquiring what we truly need to flourish. I can only hope that each client and I have been able to meet together in a truly productive way that will last for the rest of their lifetime. Our goal is to see each individual\u2019s suffering and to transform it into compassion, peace, laughter, even some joy, in an assertive meaningful way to go on with the rest of life. In the process, we have moved away from indulging in despair alone. We have learned that anger, hate, retaliation, or passive aggressive behavior never defeats the anger and hate that has personally visited us, and resides on this planet. We have let go of resentment, straightened out misconceptions, and replaced both with as much forgiveness as possible. Even though there will always be challenges and difficulties that lie ahead, we can move towards the inherent goodness that still lies behind each struggle with a stolid intelligence, courage, persistence, and stability. Each client has learned from our relationship that compassionate listening reduces suffering for both themselves, loved ones, friends and professional relationships. From this vantage point they can come to others in peace, building a sense of safety, confidence and caring. The hours that I have spent with brave clients struggling with their difficult lives and in writing this book have brought to me a richness that is greater than any money I\u2019ve earned or possessions I\u2019ve acquired. My reduced-fee clients often present the most enlightening hours because the struggles they have been through"}

I listen carefully to what I say to clients, making sure that I follow my own remarks, remembering to act in a kindly way that strengthens both myself and others. Too often, I still slip and fall, but get back up to try again. However, I pray that the work and writing I have done, in the final analysis, has been strong enough to contribute to making this planet survive and become a better place for us all of us to live. For those of you who cannot or have chosen not to do psychotherapy, I hope that the dialogues, stories and essays you have read will help you in finding and reaching your own unique goals.

I have the highest respect for the hard work they have done, the emotions they have shared, and the responsibility they have taken for making their lives run successfully. Questions that have been asked many times constitute many of the tides of the following essays and dialogues. This book would not exist without my ongoing work with each client. They are my teachers and mentors, sharing with me \u201cdefining moments.\u201d No psychotherapy is a good one unless both of us learn something new. Secondly, I would like to thank my husband, David McArthur PhD as my computer expert with his immediate availability to help me format this manuscript into a presentable document, bail me out from computer errors, and keep ongoing backups of this manuscript at his work location. I thank my family for giving me time to write when it was not always convenient for them. I would like to thank Connie Hood, Charlotte Fletcher PhD, Steven McNicholl, Ruth Ridenour, Barbara Mullens-Geier, Gohar Chivichyan, Portia Artunian, Jennie Redner, MAI, and Linda Simmons for reading and supplying editing suggestions for many of the essays. Linda Simmons and I shared a joint experience of writing a book at the same time, giving each other encouragement and support.

This book would never have seen the light of day without the guidance and support from One-On-One Book Production and Marketing with Carolyn Porter and Alan Gadney. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Dorothea McArthur, PhD, ABPP is a Diplomate Clinical Psychologist maintaining a private psychotherapy practice for the past thirty-four years. She is also a wife, mother, grandmother, artist, choral singer, and author of four other books. Dr. McArthur acquired a BA from the University of Rochester in English Literature. She then attended Columbia University and the Art Students League in New York City to acquire the qualifications for her to achieve a Master of Arts in Teaching at the Rhode Island School of Design in sculpture and drawing. Dorothea married and moved to Southern California to pursue advanced degrees in psychology She acquired a M.Ed. in Counseling Psychology from the University of California in Santa Barbara, and a PhD in Clinical Psychology from the California School of Professional Psychology in Los Angeles. After seven years at the Verdugo Mental Health Center in Glendale, California, as Head of Adult Services and their training program for graduate students, Dorothea transitioned into full-time private practice. She sees individuals, couples and families, with a specialization in crisis intervention, adoption, sexual abuse, borderline personality, learning difficulties, marital issues, and surviving as a working artist. She has always maintained a sliding scale fee, believing that psychotherapy should be available for all people at all socioeconomic levels. Dorothea and her husband adopted Kendall at birth, and began a Cooperative adoption in which their daughter visited periodically with her birth family Kendall is in ongoing present contact while both birth and adoptive mothers came to know and respect each other. Kendall and her daughter, Kaitlyn, now constitute a three generational family During this time, Dr. McArthur became a Diplomate Clinical Psychologist of the American Board of Professional Psychology, and served on their board from 1987-1993. She was one of the authors for the Revised Clinical Diplomate Oral Examination Manual for Examiner and Examinee. In 1994, McArthur created the Independent Psychotherapy Network, a group of 15 psychotherapists meeting monthly to share information for the purpose of maintaining clinical practice at the highest level of quality. She has been elected their president for the past seventeen years. Dorothea\u2019s artistic talent migrated from sculpture and drawing into writing. She authored, with Dr. Glen Roberts, the director of the Verdugo Mental Health Center, the Roberts Apperception Test for Children (RATC), a projective test for children. By 1988 she had published one of the few books on the borderline patient, written specifically for the educated lay public, clients and therapists, entitled Birth of a Self in Adulthood. Two other books, besides Defining Moments, are being completed for publication. The first is Love Beyond Love, a memoir of Dorothea\u2019s family\u2019s journey through open, closed and cooperative adoption, and all of"}

In this book, Dorothea has also shared the disguised experience she gained from assisting many members of the adoption triangle (adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents) within her private practice.

Throughout the years, she has supervised many interns working with special needs kids and K-12 students in the parochial schools through a project entitled Outreach Concerns. She has done training psychotherapies for many master and doctoral level students from Alliant University. Dorothea continues her private practice in Los Angeles. In her spare time, she does gardening with succulents and takes expeditions into nature. She and her husband have enjoyed thirty years of choral singing, resulting in performances at the Los Angeles Olympics opening ceremony, Hollywood Bowl, and Los Angeles Philharmonic. Together, they rescue and care for many dogs and cats who have lived in their home over the forty- three years of marriage. To contact Dorothea S.
