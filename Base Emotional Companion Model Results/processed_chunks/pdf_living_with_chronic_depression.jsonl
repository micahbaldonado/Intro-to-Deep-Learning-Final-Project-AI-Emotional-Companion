Chronic, unremitting, and endlessly recurring depression are killers. So is the acute, severe depression that often punctuates continuing, underlying, less severe depression. They literally shorten many lives and impoverish even more. Not only a murderer, depression is a thief; it steals the joy of life. As it weighs down with implacable heaviness, it even obliviates Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201ccrack that lets the light get in.\u201d Echoing William Styron\u2019s title of his encounter with depression, it is \u201cdarkness visible\u201d as it smothers the light. Heavy, stark, and implacable, it feels unbearable. There\u2019s a whole library of books out there telling you to just change your attitude, wag your tail, and walk on the sunny side of the street. You should tell them and their authors to go fuck themselves. Let me talk about those books. In one way or another they extol the power of positive thinking and in one way or another they offer a mind cure. If you\u2019d only adjust your attitude, expectations, worldview, self- 6 concept, and philosophy, all will be well. Unfortunately, for a very large number of people that is simply not true. I assume that if you\u2019re reading this book you are one of them, or you are married to or a parent of one, or you are a therapist feeling like"}

Let me tell you about Negative Mike. A number of years ago Negative Mike was a regular attendee at Manhattan Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) meetings. A.A., an organization for which I have enormous respect, can be aggressively upbeat, even Pollyannaish. As one member after another would say something to the effect of \u201cMy worst day sober is better than my best day drunk\u201d (which is undoubtedly true) during the \u201csharing,\u201d Negative Mike would raise his hand, get recognized, and say, \u201cMy name is Mike and I am an alcoholic.\u201d He would then boom out, \u201cWe are all doomed!\u201d and sit down. Negative Mike made a tremendous positive, if I may use that word, contribution to New York A.A. during that era. He articulated the unspoken, mostly unconscious, subtext of what was going on in the minds of many of the attendees of those meetings. He was able to express, however hyperbolically, the unspeakable, thereby giving others the freedom to experience their ambivalence about recovery. As my therapist readers 7 would say, he made manifest the unconscious negative transference. In writing this book, I propose to be the Negative Mike, or in my case, the Negative Jerry of the depression industry. All these books are popularizations in one way or another of the basic message of cognitive therapy and I must concede they are excellent in their own way. Such \u201cmind cures,\u201d as they were called in the nineteenth century, have a long and honorable history, going back to the Roman Stoic philosophers. Marcus Aurelius comes to mind. When I was a graduate student in philosophy at McGill University I came down with a really miserable cold-flu syndrome. My concerned girlfriend asked me what I was doing for it, to which I replied, \u201cI\u2019m reading Marcus Aurelius.\u201d I don\u2019t remember whether or not the philosophical Roman Emperor raised my spirits, but he certainly didn\u2019t cure my upper respiratory misery. The Stoics\u2019 message was basically that nothing is good or bad in itself; thinking makes it so. Ipso facto, change your thought pattern and whatever was depressing you will lose its power. The Stoics deduced a powerful corollary to their basic premise, namely, that nothing can hurt a good man. Several centuries later, Boethius, writing from a prison cell, gave a Christian twist to Stoic philosophy. Concluding that Fortuna was a fickle 8 goddess, as witness his fall from power and prosperity to impoverished imprisonment, Boethius taught that we can rise above our circumstances to arrive at an inner calm and mental peace. Boethius called this the consolation of philosophy, which was his title. His philosophy was undergirded by Christian faith. Rather Buddhistically, he urged detachment from desire. The modern formulation would be to put in the effort without trying to dictate the outcome. More than a thousand years later, the seventeenth-century Jewish- Dutch philosopher Benedict Spinoza taught that \u201cfreedom is the acceptance of necessity\u201d"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_2", "text": "and that such acquiescence in what must be liberated man (and even perhaps woman) from what he described as \u201chuman bondage.\u201d Another pre-cognitive therapy mind cure. In the nineteenth century, William James, who himself was a major sufferer of depression, turned the deterministic Spinoza on his head, self- analyzing his despair as a product of the prevailing scientific rejection of \u201cfree will.\u201d He stated that the various arguments for and against the existence of free will, or of its opposite, determinism, were equally unconvincing. Accordingly, he declared that his first act of free will would be to believe that he had it and that he was a free moral agent, thereby lifting his depression, at least to the extent of allowing him to get 9 off his parents\u2019 couch and finish medical school. James, a fervent believer in the \u201cmind cure,\u201d nevertheless suffered repeated recurrences of his depression. Then there\u2019s Norman Vincent Peale and The Power of Positive Thinking. Nothing against Dr. Peale, but one of my more tormented-by- recurrent-depression patients is a wildly enthusiastic believer in the power of positive thinking. Perhaps, that has helped her, but it certainly has not cured her depression. I shall have more to say about cognitive therapy in the section on treatment, but for now let me simply say that cognitive therapy helps many recover from depressive episodes and that all those self-help books offering one version or another of it can also be helpful. Nevertheless, my considerable experience is that neither is a long-term cure for the more serious forms of chronic depression. There is also a glut of books teaching meditation, relaxation, forgiveness, and \u201cspiritual\u201d uplift of one sort or another. These, too, are touted as cures for depression. They, too, often help, but they do not cure. In fact, I\u2019ve treated patient after patient who has told me that both the cognitively inspired and the uplift literature that they\u2019ve read so avidly 10 wound up making them feel worse. Sometimes their therapists\u2019 unrealistic expectations (real or imagined) make them feel worse still. You may identify with these patients of mine. Being unable to successfully avail yourself of any of these panaceas, you feel like a failure\u2014not that you didn\u2019t feel that way before having something (all these books) to reinforce your feelings of failure. There must be something wrong with you\u2014wrong in a moral sense\u2014for you to have failed to recover as the books and perhaps a misguided therapist have told you you should. All in all, great fuel for your self-hatred furnace. Then there are the biological treatments (of which I have more to say below), primarily antidepressant drugs. They, too, often help. There\u2019s no doubt that they have substantially improved the lives of some who suffer from depression. If you are among the many who have been strong responders to antidepressant meds, you are not reading this book. Rather, you must be one of the \u201ctreatment resistant,\u201d a damning phrase if there ever was one. Almost nobody says"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_3", "text": "in print, let alone in the media, that many people suffering depression are little aided by antidepressants, or that they often lose their efficacy over time, or that their side effects in 11 doses some need to get therapeutic response are so hard to live with that the sufferer joins the non-compliant. So I will say the unsayable. The unhappy truth is that for some, in fact a large number, of those suffering from chronic depression, there is no cure. Rather, there are treatments, psychological and biological, that help, and they are most certainly worthy trying, however limited their effects or the duration of those effects. One of the worst things you can do is to self-label and you may have had all too much help with that label as a \u201ctreatment failure.\u201d You need to hear the truth that depression can be a bitch and a half and that you are not responsible for that. Chronic depression is a disability and what is called for is an adjustment to this disability: learning to live with and in spite of it, learning how to get the maximum satisfaction out of life that is possible, both during interludes between depressive episodes and insofar as possible during the episodes themselves. This is the rehabilitation approach, one that is clearly needed; yet to the best of my knowledge, nobody has proposed it. I\u2019m doing so, and in doing so not promising you too much while suggesting a coping strategy for what Winston Churchill, another sufferer from depression, called \u201cblack dog.\u201d 12 Being depressed is depressing, and nobody says that either, however obvious it may be. Being chronically depressed is also infuriating, and what you do with that fury is fateful in determining how satisfactory a life will be possible for you. Amazingly, this, too, isn\u2019t discussed except in professional psychoanalytic literature. Mourning is crucial to the rehabilitation approach. Mourning has a multifaceted relationship to depression. Failure to mourn often causes depression and depression itself needs to be mourned. You who suffer chronic depression need to mourn the losses that entails, the diminution of possibility, the very real pain and limitations imposed by the disease. Mourning is hard work; yet in the best of cases it comes to an end with acceptance. Facilitating that mourning is something therapists can do to help. So can writers, and that is something I hope to assist you in doing. The acceptance of disability may be a Zen paradox, radically altering the existential meaning of the disability and even the disability itself, this being especially true when the disability is an emotional one. As I have said, I don\u2019t want to promise too much and make the same error the authors on depression I\u2019ve criticized for being too Pollyannaish do about the curative powers of my approach. Nor do I wish to sound like someone advising the quadriplegic to \u201csuck it up.\u201d Nevertheless, the Zen- 13 like paradoxical effect of mourning and accepting disability, including chronic depression, is"}

Insight and knowledge help, even when they can\u2019t cure. Accordingly, I will try to convey to you what we know or theorize about depression, its causes, and its treatment. 14 Chapter 1: Ron Smith\u2019s Story What is chronic depression? Before trying to answer this question scientifically or theoretically, let me share an instance. Dr. Ronald Smith came to me in his early sixties, having felt hurt and misunderstood by his previous therapist. He told me the following story. Try to identify with the doctor, not in the particulars of his life, but rather in the pain of his depression. \u201cDr. Levin, I\u2019ve no idea what happened or why. I was a reasonably happy child. My parents fought a lot, one of my sisters committed suicide, and one of my brothers died of a drug overdose, so it couldn\u2019t have been such a bed of roses. But I remember it that way. Happy. I had artistic talent and started drawing, later painting, very young. My father, in particular, was very proud. He would show my work to guests and I really got off on that until puberty when I became very shy. But there was a lot of fun. We skied and had summer trips to the mountains. I had friends. I did well in school. Nothing, I repeat nothing, forecast the misery and failure of my adult life. In high school my art teachers told me I would never be more than a gifted amateur. I don\u2019t remember being 15 hurt by that. I never actually thought of a career as an artist. My parents joked that I might be a genius, knowing that wasn\u2019t true, and wanted me to have a more conventional, safer profession. My father taught biology in a junior college and had pushed me towards medicine. The only problem was I was lousy at science\u2014well, not quite, but not very good. If I suffered disappointment about not having the stuff to be an artist, it passed. I was a reader and discovered Freud early. He intrigued me. My guidance counselor suggested clinical psychology as an alternative to medicine. I didn\u2019t even know there was such a thing. But that\u2019s what I am, a clinical psychologist. I\u2019m embarrassed, ashamed to tell you that. For you see, I had a depressive breakdown in my late twenties and I haven\u2019t really recovered since. Better times and worse, but never really well. Me, a psychologist! So sick in the head I can\u2019t work. I haven\u2019t held a job or practiced for the past thirty years. \u201cI was in the army when it happened. That doesn\u2019t make sense either. I loved the army. I was an officer. I enjoyed the life; the structure and discipline appealed to me. I got to travel. Yet I wound up in a booby hatch\u2014a military one\u2014just like the ones I had staffed. It\u2019s appalling; it\u2019s humiliating."}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_5", "text": "You\u2019d think that after all those years it wouldn\u2019t bother me. But it does, especially knowing I was coming here and would have to tell 16 you. Such shame. I\u2019m sick of shame. It\u2019s haunted me since I was thirty. And my last shrink\u2014I\u2019ve had lots of them\u2014told me that I was one of those \u2018treatment-resistant\u2019 cases that don\u2019t want to get well. I got angry\u2014 something very unusual for me\u2014and I became assertive. I have a tough time talking back to authority figures, but I told him he was a sadistic idiot and ran out of the room. That felt good, but not for long. I got scared. I realized that I couldn\u2019t be without a therapist, so I called you. \u201cLet me tell you more about my breakdown. No, let me tell you something about my \u2018pre-morbid\u2019 self and its\u2014that is my\u2014earlier experiences. I knew from my studies that there is often a \u2018red line\u2019 running way back before people get sick. I don\u2019t have one. When I was a kid and into Freud my family joked that I should be a psychiatrist. So I don\u2019t think they thought me very strange then. \u201cBut I do remember a few traumatic\u2014sort of cumulatively traumatic\u2014aspects of my childhood. My mother never punished us. Instead she would say to me (I\u2019m not sure if she said it to my sibs), \u2018I\u2019m going to drop dead from you,\u2019 when I misbehaved. Not that I did much of anything. I was a very docile, obedient kid. She would say \u2018You\u2019re going to be the death of me\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to die from you\u2019 when I did things like come home from school late or punch one of my brothers. Nothing 17 very major. When she did drop dead, well after my breakdown, decades later, was absolutely sure that I had killed her. I was terribly depressed by then\u2014something she hated\u2014and I believed my depression killed her\u2014 triggered her heart attack. In my saner moments I know that isn\u2019t true. Still, when I\u2019m real down I think of myself as a rat who killed his mother. \u201cThen there was sex. My parents didn\u2019t talk about it, yet I \u2018knew,\u2019 felt, they would be disappointed by any sexual expression by me. My father was something of a Calvinist, a tepid Congregationalist in practice, and he only had to look at me to make me feel guilty. My mother had given us enemas when we were sick\u2014I hated them\u2014all those cramps and ugh\u2014yet when I felt stirrings when I was 13, I got the crazy idea of giving myself an enema. I did and I came. Speaking of ugh, even talking about it makes me sick, even now. I never did that again. I knew enough Freud to know it was a kind of incest\u2014sex with my mother, her being the \u2018phallic mother\u2019 who used to be in all those papers I read in grad school. I\u2019m blushing even now. Horrible. Killed my mother and"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_6", "text": "had perverted sex with her. Again, I know that\u2019s crazy. Yet when I\u2019m depressed I think about it\u2014obsessively. \u2018You killed her, you pervert,\u2019 I used to say to myself when I was at my very worst, in my blackest depressions. 18 \u201cI\u2019m glad I told you that. Guilty secrets are tormentors. I know that, so, painful as it is, I try and talk about it. With most of my shrinks I was too afraid, too ashamed, but I told the last one and you know how that turned out. \u201cUnfortunately, I have a more serious guilty secret. I had sex with a patient. I was in Europe when I was in the army. Diane was in the service too. She came for anxiety and became a weekly psychotherapy patient. She was on the hysterical side and tended to exaggerate, so I\u2019m not sure this was true. She told me that she lost her virginity to a boxer\u2014her boxer dog, that is. Probably he humped her without penetrating, but who knows? That really turned me on\u2014I told you I was a pervert\u2014and when she came on to me I forgot all about interpreting the transference and asked her out. Treatment stopped and we became lovers. It wasn\u2019t just sex; I really loved her. After a year I was transferred, and then I had my breakdown. Being separated from Diane when I was transferred was a real, deep loss for me. I still think about her and miss her. We occasionally correspond even now. Diane has grown children now and I\u2019m sure she feels sorry for me because of the way my depression has ruined my life. I don\u2019t think she has romantic feelings, but even if she did, I don\u2019t think they would do me any good. My affair with Diane is the 19 thing I should feel most guilty about. Not about the stupid kid thing with the enema bag, but I don\u2019t. My relationship with Diane was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I don\u2019t feel guilty about it, I don\u2019t think. What I do feel is guilty about not feeling guilty. I never had another girlfriend. \u201cI think my mother was depressed. She used to go to her room for hours and sleep and think about God knows what. She covered it up and was cheerful around us. She had a Jewish background. I think it was her grandparents\u2019 generation that had converted. My mother had no time for religion. She said it was all balderdash. My father was active in his church and he read his Bible every day, but he didn\u2019t push it on us, at least not very hard. Still, I think he believed in Darwin more than in Christ and yet the Calvinist God of predestined damnation was vaguely present in our home. I think He played a role in my depression. I certainly feel damned. Yeah, predestined to be damned. It was never talked about but I sure as"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_7", "text": "hell felt damned from the time I was thirty till now. Well, not all the time\u2014it recurs and it recurs. \u201cBack to my mother. She told me, more than once, about a great aunt who had drowned falling into a river while koshering a pot in some godforsaken shtetl in Russia. The story seemed important to her. 20 Drowned koshering a pot? I doubt it. She must have been a suicide. My mother was very secretive about her past, her family, and their ancestors. My feeling\u2014no, conviction\u2014is that there was a lot of mental illness in her family\u2014probably depression\u2014and she was ashamed of it. My father would occasionally ask Mother to take us to synagogue because of her Jewish roots. She never did. It\u2019s sad, but I\u2019ve gotten less comfort from religion than I\u2019ve had pleasure from sex. \u201cMy high school years were unremarkable. I did okay, had some friends, was horny, didn\u2019t do well with the few girls I approached, enjoyed sports a lot as a fan, had all the baseball stars and their stats at my fingertips, and I loved to swim. Doesn\u2019t sound depressed to me. Maybe a little. College was very much the same. The trouble started in graduate school. I was away from home for the first time and very lonely. Unlike my undergraduate psych major, I found the clinical psych program forbiddingly difficult. I worked very hard and still wound up flunking statistics and physiological psychology. I was almost thrown out, but they let me repeat those courses and two others I had barely passed. In effect, I redid the year. That was the first time I was consciously depressed. I walked around saying to myself, \u2018Ron, you stupid fucking idiot.\u2019 No great shakes in high school. Still I never flunked 21 anything and I did really well in college. That first year in graduate school really shook me up\u2014washed out whatever confidence I had. And now I was overtly afraid of women. If they got to know me they\u2019d find out I was a stupid fucking idiot. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever really regained my confidence. Nevertheless I plugged away, repeating the year, went on to get my doctorate, writing a pretty damn good dissertation. \u201cI didn\u2019t even try and get a job. I went directly into the service. That seemed like salvation. Like I told you, I came to love it. I had rank, I really enjoyed the clinical work, and I think I helped people. I was something of a patriot, so being an army officer was good for my self- esteem. Then it was the affair with Diane. When I was transferred and she didn\u2019t seem to mind, I was devastated. I had thought she loved me, while most probably to her I was, as the kids say now, a friend with benefits. And somewhere I had to feel guilty about the way that started. \u201cAt first I broke down physically. I developed severe asthma, almost died, and was hospitalized"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_8", "text": "several times. I was tested for everything: no allergies, no family history. In retrospect it was psychosomatic. There used to be a theory that asthma was triggered by separation anxiety; I think that was the case with me. I was reassigned, not to an outpatient psychotherapy unit but rather as staff in a psychiatric unit. I started 22 feeling utterly inadequate, got more and more anxious, and became convinced I couldn\u2019t do it. Finally, I locked myself in my apartment and just sat there eating popcorn for days. Finally my commanding officer showed up with two MPs and broke the door down. I wouldn\u2019t answer it. I must have been near catatonic. They shipped me out to a mental hospital in the States. The journey was a useless, unending humiliation. The shrink needed shrinking. \u201cI was an inpatient for two months, released on heavy meds, given light duty, and then allowed to resign my commission and leave the service with an honorable discharge. I went back home and got worse and worse. I would just sit for hours, full of self-hate, rage and despair. My family was at first sympathetic and supportive. They soon became furious at me. They were especially furious when I refused to look for a job. I couldn\u2019t, but they just didn\u2019t get it. They called me horrible things. One that sticks is \u2018malingering parasite.\u2019 The sister who later committed suicide was the most vicious. Finally I gave it back to her saying, \u2018You insensitive bitch, I hope you die.\u2019 And of course she did, by her own hand, and I blame myself for that, too. Guilt and I are great friends. Sort of Bobbsey twins. But that\u2019s not funny. It ruined my life. 23 \u201cThose years after the service were hell. Leaden deadness, tormenting self-accusation, impotent fury at my parents and siblings, in fact at the whole world, and what felt like terminal aloneness. Nobody understood, nobody could or wanted to reach me. To try and do anything was a crippling struggle. It was like living deep underwater, desperate for air; moving was like walking in molasses. Time sometimes stopped and sometimes rushed pell-mell toward the end\u2014toward death, which would have been welcome. \u201cI refused to go to therapy, which made my father ballistic. There were terrible, terrible fights. Finally, he dragged me to a shrink, the first of many. It wasn\u2019t much help\u2014maybe a little. And the meds\u2014every one in the PDR [Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference] at one time or another. They helped some, then stopped helping, and then I would try another. Several \u2018authorities\u2019 suggested ECT [electroconvulsive therapy]. My parents wouldn\u2019t sign for that. The years passed. I mostly vegetated, becoming the male equivalent of Rochester\u2019s wife in the attic. I had \u2018good days\u2019 when I went out, even went on a few job interviews but nothing came of them. My sister checked out. Then a few years later my brother OD\u2019d. Horrible for my parents. I tried to be there for them. I"}

No. Identifying with Ron Smith Ron Smith\u2019s lifelong depression raises many etiological, treatment, and how-to-endure issues to which I shall return. For the moment, I want to invite your identification with aspects of Ron\u2019s experience. First, the absence of a sufficient cause, at least in his mind. Where many explanations can be given, it is likely that none will convince. This mystery about the why and how of many depressions, perhaps including yours, in spite of all the neurochemical, genetic, psychodynamic and 26 cognitive theories, adds to the torment. We human beings seek to understand, particularly understand pain. Yet frustratingly enough, often we don\u2019t. Then there\u2019s the stuckness in the past, the ruminating about long past acts such as"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_10", "text": "Ron\u2019s admittedly somewhat bizarre first sexual experience, which hurt nobody, or about things said or done to us, such as Ron\u2019s mother\u2019s telling the naughty child, \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me!\u201d Do you have such tapes running in your head that you can\u2019t erase? Then there is what I call \u201csatanic grandiosity,\u201d the feeling, indeed conviction, that \u201cI am the worst person in the world.\u201d Ron doesn\u2019t quite say that. Yet his readiness to say it is always there. Certainly it is one of his beliefs. You may know perfectly well at some level that it isn\u2019t true, especially since your name isn\u2019t Hitler or Stalin. Yet you can\u2019t get the thought that you\u2019re the worst person in the world out of your head. And less specifically, you may identify with Ron\u2019s self-loathing. How about being stuck in the molasses? Or the slowing down or galloping of time? You may identify with Ron\u2019s crippling feelings of shame at having the illness at all. Or with his rage at the harm it is doing to him. Or with his being depressed about being depressed. Or you may identify with Ron\u2019s guilty, shameful secrets (although yours will be different) or with his despair. Or you may 27 identify with the fearsome, awesome, punitive, Calvinistic God who inchoately hovers around his childhood home or with his earthly father\u2019s vocalizations of the Heavenly Father\u2019s injunctions, now becoming part of your self\u2014an internal voice. Psychoanalysts call such internalized voices introjects or perhaps a better metaphor, tapes that won\u2019t erase running in your head. Such introjects powerfully contribute to depression. To make matters worse, they are often unconscious, yet no less, in fact more, tormenting. You may identify with the family secrets and silences, especially if there is an intimation of a family curse\u2014depression\u2014as is true of Ron Smith\u2019s family or in your family or perhaps your strongest identification with our protagonist is with his sadness at the cost and waste inflicted by that goddam depression. If so, there\u2019s some hope here. Sadness has a complex relationship to depression. Persistent, particularly unaccounted for sadness is a symptom of depression. Yet to be sad is not necessarily to be depressed. Sadness is a feeling; depression is a disease and paradoxically, experiencing the true depth of your sadness can sometimes be an effective antidote for depression. But more of this later. I invite, indeed urge you to identify with Ron Smith, not with the particulars of the circumstances of his life or with his individual 28 obsessive thoughts, but rather with his feelings and his global experience, because such identification lessens that horrible, horrible grip of isolation, uniqueness, and radical aloneness that so exacerbate the already awful stuff you endure. You don\u2019t want to lose yourself in that identification; you do want to know that you\u2019re not alone and that opens the possibility of learning something useful from your fellow sufferers. Perhaps most saliently, such identification mitigates shame and guilt, especially shame. Defining Chronic Depression Let us go"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_11", "text": "on to review some treatment options and look at what they offer and don\u2019t offer. They can be characterized as psycho- pharmacological, somatic, and psychotherapeutic, respectively. But before going there, let me say a little more about chronic depression. Its most salient feature is its persistence. The damn thing just doesn\u2019t go away. Yes, you have some pretty good interludes when it\u2019s in remission, and then there\u2019s another episode. Sort of a mental cancer. Every time you think it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s back. Maybe not quite in the same form. Ron Smith\u2019s depression sort of burned out in the sense that the radical torment of his post-service days has passed, but sadly, the gray 29 bleakness he lives in is depressed enough. True, gray is better than black, but it\u2019s no great shakes. I once had a patient I was trying to convince to try antidepressant meds saying, \u201cYou\u2019re living in a black hole. Your life is endless blackness.\u201d Before I could press my selling point that medication might brighten his life, he interrupted, \u201cDoctor, couldn\u2019t we say dark gray?\u201d That feeble attempt at humor proved prognostically favorable and his depression turned out not to be chronic. Unfortunately, yours is. Another misfortune lies in the fact that an episode of severe depression makes it more likely that you will have subsequent ones. That phenomenon is referred to as kindling. Staying on antidepressants\u2014when they work\u2014lessens the likelihood or possibly delays a new episode, so by staying on your antidepressant, you dampen the kindling, so to speak. Yet, as you know, that doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent subsequent episodes. The American Psychiatric Association has a sort of doomsday book, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), now in its fourth edition, revised. It is not as successful as it claims\u2014witness that fact that illnesses come and go as new editions come out. Evidently there are political considerations in deciding what is or is not a mental illness. Depressive disorder, however, appears in all editions. Your 30 problem is called Major Depression or Major Depressive Disorder to distinguish it from a milder form of depression called Dysthymia and from Bipolar Disorder, previously called Manic Depression, in which episodes of depression alternate with episodes of mania. You even have a number, or rather, more accurately, your disease has a number: 296.33, where the first 3 after the decimal point indicates that it is recurrent and the second that it is severe. Depressions are further characterized (not in the DSM-IV) as agitated or retarded. You probably have experience with both. In agitated depression, you are anxious, restless, filled with directionless energy you don\u2019t know what to do with and can\u2019t channel usefully. In retarded depression you slow down, just can\u2019t get mobilized, or are stuck in the molasses. In the course of a chronic depression one or the other predominates. They are somewhat different but equally awful. Another distinction is between angry and empty depression. There is more anger, sometimes without much awareness of it, in"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_12", "text": "the agitation and more emptiness in the retardation. Once again, you\u2019ve probably experienced both: impotent rage and feeling like one of those that T. S. Eliot called \u201cthe hollow men, the straw men.\u201d Both are awful, but the feeling of hollowness, of having no good stuff, or worse, no stuff at all, 31 is, I think, harder to take than an angry depression. The experience of emptiness in an empty depression is puzzling. Is this purely neurochemical? Is it a representation of the impoverishment concomitant with deep depression? Is it a reflection of the inability to make meaningful emotional connections when you\u2019re deeply depressed so it feels like there\u2019s nothing inside? Or perhaps it\u2019s some combination of these. I would like to suggest yet another possibility. I think sometimes the feeling of emptiness in empty depression comes from the fact that what is present is sealed off, so to speak, under the basement floor, and what is under there is emotion of various sorts, particularly anger, indeed even rage. So if you experience an empty depression, do a self-probe and see if you come up with a lot of anger underneath the emptiness. You may very well do so, and of course you feel so empty because the prime emotion you\u2019re currently experiencing is not available being, as I said, underneath the floorboards. Some of the more acute symptoms listed in the DSM-IV such as appetite loss and sleep disturbances are unfortunately usually integrated into chronic depression and they just linger, impoverishing your life and diminishing your vitality and capacity for joy. Therein lies the chronicity, along with the ever-present possibility of acuteness. There are many ways 32 to explain the chronicity. A now discarded one, although it held the field for hundreds of years, is what\u2019s called the humour theory, which accounted for differences in temperament by the balance or predominance of one of the four humours: blood, phlegm, choler (yellow bile), and melancholy (black bile). So one could be sanguine (cheerful), choleric (that is angry), phlegmatic (calm), or melancholy (depressed). Your temperament and potential for being depressed are determined by the balance of humors you came into the world with. It is worth noting that Galen, the second century Roman physician who first articulated the theory, believed that melancholy was a necessary ingredient (in proper balance) for physical and mental health. Modern views of temperament see it as largely genetically determined, and some temperaments do predispose to depression. Some have even proposed the existence of a built-in hapistat that is preset by one\u2019s genes to an equilibrium point on a happiness scale. Temperament does play a role in your susceptibility to depression, but the hapistat metaphor is too deterministic for my taste and it\u2019s just that, a metaphor. Considerations of temperament bring to mind the author of Ecclesiastes\u2014reputedly Solomon\u2014who famously wrote \u201cvanity of vanities, all is vanity.\u201d Was he a melancholic, (i.e. a chronic depressive) 33 or was he a realist? Would he have written a different book"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_13", "text": "if he had been on Zoloft or Prozac? Impossible to say, but it is noteworthy that the author of Ecclesiastes finds power, riches, wisdom and pleasure all empty because death takes the wise man no less than the fool, which suggests that one\u2019s attitude toward and beliefs about death are highly consequential determinants of one\u2019s propensity to depression. And of course the vector also goes the other way, depression strongly colors one\u2019s response to the finality of death. 34 Chapter 2: Treatment Options: Their Uses and Limitations If you are reading this book, you probably know more than I do about treatments, having tried so many of them. Nevertheless, the summary of the tools available and some comments on them may prove useful. The good news is that we do indeed have better treatments, whatever their limitations, and research may well give us yet better ones. Psychopharmacological Treatments Let\u2019s start with the pharmacological. The oldest class of drugs used to treat depression is the amphetamines. These are stimulant drugs that increase the quantity of excitatory neurotransmitters in the synapses of some circuits in the brain. \u201cCome again?\u201d you say. The cells of the nervous system\u2014the neurons\u2014including the brain, don\u2019t quite connect with each other. The gap between them is called the synapse. Chemicals\u2014neurotransmitters\u2014go across the gap and transmit information to the cell (the post-synaptic neuron in technical terms) across the gap. These chemicals can be uppers (excitatory) or downers 35 (inhibitory). All the antidepressants act on these neurotransmitters. The stimulant ones, like the amphetamines, pump out excitatory neurotransmitters from the presynaptic (before the synapse) neurons. Since the neurochemical correlative (maybe or maybe not the cause) of depression is diminished availability of excitatory neurotransmitters resulting in slowed down transmission of information in certain brain circuits, increasing the availability of these chemicals (neurotransmitters) is a perfectly logical treatment for depression. Stimulant drugs do indeed alleviate depression, so we have the, or at least a, cure\u2014no? Unfortunately, no. Why not? The nervous system quickly habituates to drugs like amphetamines, necessitating raising the dose. At higher doses, they have all sorts of baleful side effects, including anxiety and jumpiness. A drug you need more and more of is an addictive drug. So these days psychopharmacological stimulants are rarely used alone in the treatment of depression. They are sometimes used to supplement other antidepressant drugs and you may have had them prescribed with that purpose. Sometimes their addition results in a treatment response when there was a weak one or none at all. The psychostimulants have largely been supplemented by antidepressants. They work differently than the stimulants. Instead of 36 increasing the quantity of excitatory neurotransmitters, they prevent their reuptake. What does that mean? Well, once the excitatory chemical is in the synapse it would continue to jazz up the post-synaptic neuron forever and serve no useful purpose since it is the difference in the rate the neurons \u201cfire\u201d that conveys the information that it is the nervous system\u2019s job to carry. \u201cFire\u201d in this"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_14", "text": "context means setting off an electrochemical reaction that acts as a signal. To prevent this, the neurotransmitter, so to speak, is sucked up back into the neuron before the synapse\u2014reuptake is the technical term. One class of antidepressants slows this reuptake, making more excitatory transmitters available. Since depression is down and excitatory transmitters are up, they have the potential to lift depression. There are several types of antidepressants. The oldest are called tricyclic because there are three rings in their molecules. Elavil is the most frequently prescribed tricyclic. It is quite effective, especially for severe, acute depression. Unfortunately, there is a price tag on everything and Elavil and its relatives have problems. The neurotransmitters antidepressants are supposed to work on are primarily serotonin and norepinephrine. The tricyclics unfortunately also act to depress a neurotransmitter called acetylchlorine. This \u201canti-chlorinergic effect \u201c is 37 hard to live with, causing dry mouth, constipation, and sometimes urinary retention, among other things. These side effects are intensely uncomfortable and feel invasive. In common with other classes of antidepressants, the tricyclics can lose their effectiveness over time so they aren\u2019t much prescribed these days. They\u2019re usually used when other drugs don\u2019t work. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants these days are SSRIs, that is, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which increase the availability of the excitatory neurotransmitter serotonin in the synapse. SSRIs are called selective because they target particular neurotransmitters, usually serotonin, sometimes serotonin and norepinephrine while not affecting neurotransmitters like acetylchlorine in ways that cause the unpleasant side effects that the older tricyclics did. The first of them was Prozac, a billion-dollar seller. One day I came home to have my wife tell me, \u201cThe doctor put Priscilla on Prozac.\u201d Priscilla was a German shepherd, who, so far as I could tell, was not in the least depressed. Oversold, perhaps, yet Prozac and its cousins helped many and still do help many people. Other commonly prescribed SSRIs include Zoloft and Cymbalta. Cymbalta differs from Prozac, Zoloft and, to name another popular one, Lexapro, in that it affects the reuptake of 38 norepinephrine as well as the reuptake of serotonin. In fact, it is believed to act primarily on norepinephrine. It is a drug worth trying if you\u2019ve gotten minimal or no response from one of the serotonin reuptake blockers. It gives you another option. What about the down side of the SSRIs? There are quite a few. They don\u2019t work for everyone or for all depressions; they often lose their effectiveness over time; they take roughly six to eight weeks to be fully operative; they commonly result in weight gain, particularly in women; and they can have sexual side effects. Women may have trouble getting aroused and have difficulty or find it impossible to orgasm. Men may have problems with achieving and maintaining an erection and/or in coming. When people are maximally depressed, they don\u2019t care much about sex, but if they get an antidepressant effect from their SSRI they do care and this becomes a not"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_15", "text": "trivial side effect, leading to non-compliance, that is, going off the drug. The same phenomenon happens with weight gain. Additionally, some people are anxious or jumpy on SSRIs, especially when they first go on them. Most, but not all, accommodate and become less anxious. What if you have a \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d depression that doesn\u2019t respond to stimulants or SSRIs and a trial on a tricyclic doesn\u2019t work 39 either? Well, there\u2019s yet another class of antidepressant that might be worth trying called MAO inhibitors. Incidentally, \u201ctreatment-resistant\u201d is meant to refer to your depression, not to you, but it is often heard that way and unfortunately sometimes the frustrated prescriber unwittingly thinks of you as the agent resisting treatment. MAO inhibitor means monoamine oxidase inhibitor. When one of those excitatory neurotransmitters like serotonin are out in the synapse they are not only reuptaken, they are chemically degraded\u2014rendered inoperative by chemicals, enzymes that are also in the synapse. They do their work by oxidizing the neurotransmitter, that is, they facilitate the combination of the neurotransmitter with oxygen, in effect burning it up. Those enzymes contain one amine group in their molecule, hence are called monoamine oxidases (MAOs). This type of antidepressant inhibits the action of the enzyme that degrades excitatory neurotransmitters, resulting in a greater availability of those excitatory neurotransmitters: serotonin, norepinephrine, or both. MAO inhibitors are not often prescribed, and for good reason. They are dangerous. The person taking them must totally avoid a rather long list of foods, certain cheeses, for example, that contain amino acids that are acted on by the MAO inhibitors. Such interaction sends blood 40 pressure skyrocketing, thereby radically increasing the risk of a disabling or fatal stroke. If you\u2019ve been on a MAO inhibitor, you know how careful you must be. To be on one would make a nervous wreck of me, but people on them have to be careful and serious complications are rare. Yet, if nothing else has worked, an MAO inhibitor is worth a try. As with all antidepressants, not everyone responds, effectiveness may lessen or cease over time, and there are probably side effects of which I am unaware. The most widely prescribed MAO inhibitor is Parnate. Welbutrin is another antidepressant that doesn\u2019t fit easily into any class. It is a sort of entity unto itself. It, too, is a reuptake blocker. However, it blocks the reuptake of two neurotransmitters: norepinephrine and dopamine, a combination not targeted by other anti-depressants. Dopamine, which plays many roles in the nervous system, is the key neurotransmitter in the pleasure centers of the brain. It therefore makes sense that a treatment that increases the availability of dopamine, thereby further stimulating the pleasure centers, would he helpful to someone who is depressed. Welbutrin is most often prescribed in conjunction with another antidepressant. It has a number of advantages. It does not have sexual side effects and it does not promote weight gain. It does, however, make some people nervous, and like all antidepressants, it 41 is prone"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_16", "text": "to failure, or at least radical diminution of its effectiveness over the course of time. As far as I know, it is not addictive. So Welbutrin offers another possibility for psychopharmacological treatment. Psychiatrists, psychopharmacologists, and primary care physicians who are the ones that actually do much of the prescribing for depression often have to play with dosages and with competing SSRIs (these days, there\u2019s a slew of them) trying to find an effective treatment. This is more empirical than scientific, sort of trial and error, though there are rationalizations for using one rather than another of the SSRIs to treat a given symptom profile of a depression. However, they aren\u2019t very convincing. If you\u2019ve been living with depression for a long time, you have probably gone through a lot of such juggling and you know how extraordinarily frustrating it can be. Nevertheless, it is most certainly worth playing around this way to try to get a response, especially if a drug that worked for you has ceased to do so. There\u2019s yet one more psychopharmacological strategy for treating intolerable depression, that is adding an antipsychotic to the regimen. The heavily advertised drug Abilify is just such an antipsychotic. Sometimes this works, at least for a while. The down side of adding an antipsychotic is that there is some risk of developing tardive dyskinesia, an irreversible 42 movement disorder, especially if you stay on it for a long time or you are female. I\u2019m not certain what the risk is, and it is probably fairly low, but unfortunately, there are other side effects of antipsychotics. Again, if nothing else has worked for you, the addition of a drug like Abilify may be worth a try. Although this is a book about unipolar depression (i.e., depression without manic episodes), I should mention a common and effective treatment for bipolar depression, lithium carbonate. It must be monitored carefully because lithium can cause kidney damage. The so- called mood stabilizers (originally developed as anti-seizure medications) such as Tegretol are also used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. What do I conclude from all this? Psychopharmacology is good stuff, albeit oversold. Over the past generation it has offered hope to the hopeless and permitted many to recover from or mitigate their depression. But if you are reading this book, you are no longer one of those who radically benefits from psychopharmacology of your depression. Of course you don\u2019t know how much worse it could be if you were off your drug regimen, and new drugs keep coming down the pike. So my advice is to stay with whatever helps, however partially, and put yourself in the hands of a psychiatrist (if you aren\u2019t already there) who 43 assiduously keeps up with the latest advances in the chemical treatment of depression. I should mention once again another bit of bad news. There\u2019s a phenomenon called \u201ckindling\u201d in which earlier depressions act as kindling for later depressive episodes, making them worse. So it is wise to do"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_17", "text": "anything possible, including psychopharmacology, not only to attenuate present pain, but to mitigate the possibility of recurrence of severe episodes. On the skeptical response side to antidepressants, there are several studies that show that cognitive psychotherapy of depression is at least as effective, if not more effective, than drugs for the treatment of mildly and moderately severe depression. These studies go back to one reported by the founder of cognitive therapy, Aaron Beck, twenty years ago. However, it is not so clear at this time if the more severe, chronic depression you suffer is better treated with some forms of psychotherapy than with medication. At this stage of the game, you\u2019re probably staying with medication because you have little to lose, but you are pretty damn frustrated because it isn\u2019t helping you all that much. 44 There is an association between alcohol use, especially alcohol abuse, and depression. Lots of people self-medicate depression with alcohol. It is the wrong antidepressant and only makes matters worse. Being an anesthetic, booze gives temporary relief from the pain of depression; being a central nervous system depressant, it actually exacerbates it. The use of stimulant drugs like cocaine is similarly futile. True, there is a pleasurable rush, but then a terrible crash. Don\u2019t be your own psychopharmacologist with \u201crecreational\u201d drugs. They won\u2019t help and just create a new problem. In the course of your chronic depression, you may have found this out for yourself. Somatic Treatments The somatic treatments we will consider here are of three types: electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and vagal nerve stimulators. ECT, colloquially referred to as \u201cshock treatment,\u201d has a bad rep, and indeed is an invasive procedure with significant risk. It can also be a lifesaver in severe suicidal depression. The response to it is often dramatic. On psychiatric hospital wards, patients who one day were slumped into withdrawn, almost catatonic lumps, are seen after a few treatments walking around conversing cheerfully. So ECT has its uses. In the past it was often 45 misused to treat conditions it could not help, such as schizophrenia, and in assaultive ways for too-long courses of treatment, delivering too many shocks to the brain. This is no longer done. The ways it is administered have also evolved. Today, the shock is usually delivered to only one side of the brain and muscle relaxants and anesthetics eliminate such adverse effects as broken bones in the course of the ensuing convulsion. The most pernicious side effect, a troublesome, potential debilitating one, memory loss, is minimized. When using modern ECT protocols, not only is memory disturbance minimized, but recovery with restoration of normal cognitive functioning is far quicker. Having said this, ECT is still somewhat analogous to starting a stuck engine by banging on it with a hammer and a crude method for shaking things up and getting them working again. You may have had ECT and hopefully it helped you. It is clearly useful in acute, dangerous, severe depression that does"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_18", "text": "not respond to psychopharmacological treatment and is not accessible to talk therapy. When it works, it alleviates the worst symptoms. It is not, however, a cure for depression, which more often than not recurs. Additionally, memory loss, although this does not usually occur, can indeed persist. So ECT is a heroic treatment to be used only in situations calling for heroic 46 interventions. It has little or nothing to offer for the type of chronic depression we are discussing. On the other hand, a newer treatment, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), may have something to offer you. Apparently it works somewhat like ECT while being minimally invasive. Instead of delivering a shock to the brain it infuses it with magnetic energy, a painless procedure that does not involve either loss of consciousness or loss of memory. To go back to my analogy, if ECT acts somewhat like the use of a hammer to jump start a stalled engine, TMS is more like shaking the engine while bathing it in warm water. TMS\u2019s effectiveness is not well established; empirical evidence supporting its use in the treatment of depression is weak. However, I do know two psychiatrists I greatly respect who report some striking successes with hitherto intractable depression using this method. That doesn\u2019t mean it works for everybody or that it would work for you. There are some down sides. It is a time-intensive treatment requiring four sessions of approximately two hours, four days a week, for six weeks, and in all probability a reduced maintenance schedule thereafter. It is expensive. Insurance companies tend to be highly resistant to paying 47 for TMS, but after a protracted struggle, some of them do. If nothing else has helped you, TMS is worth investigating. Vagus nerve stimulators were developed at Duke University as a treatment for intractable depression. The vagus nerve carries messages to and from the brain to a wide variety of internal organs, stimulating smooth muscle. It does so in the stomach, for example, and also plays a major role in regulating the heart. In this treatment a pacemaker type of device is implanted in the neck to send a message up to the brain, stimulating certain brain circuits. The initial results were promising. The stimulator was surgically implanted, the device regulating the frequency and pattern of stimulation of the vagus nerve adjusted, and some extremely depressed people were responsive. I don\u2019t know how this treatment has stood the test of time, but once again, if all other treatments have failed you, vagal stimulation is worth investigating. Psychotherapeutic Treatments Let\u2019s take a look at the psychotherapeutic possibilities. They fall into three broad categories: psychodynamic, cognitive, and interpersonal, and each has an etiological subtext. That is, the treatment is intrinsically intertwined with a theory about causality. As a therapist, if you believe 48 that depression is caused by genetically transmitted vulnerability to less than optional neurotransmitter balance and function, then you would treat psychopharmacologically to redress the balance. That is what psychopharmacologists do."}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_19", "text": "As a therapist, if you believe that this is only partly true and that this vulnerability only becomes manifest after traumatization, then you would prescribe psychopharmacology and psychotherapy. If you believe that depression is powerfully triggered by loss, by overidentification with and internalization of the lost object, by anger turned against the self, and by events precipitating massive loss of self-esteem, you would engage in psychodynamic psychotherapy. If you as a therapist believe that depression is a result of irrational thinking, then you would prescribe cognitive therapy, and if you as a therapist believe that the cause of depression, or at least the cause of the depression continuing, is disturbed relationships with other people in the present, then you would prescribe interpersonal psychotherapy. Although there are more extreme advocates who claim exclusivity for their particular approach, the truth is that they are not mutually exclusive. There is an historical dimension here as well. If we asked a medieval or Renaissance physician, he would cite the imbalance of the humours, discussed above, with the predominance of one of them (black bile) being 49 the cause of melancholia. We moderns have a different metaphor. Instead of speaking of the humors, we talk about the neurotransmitters. If you think about it, the two aren\u2019t all that different. Perhaps instead of describing people and their personalities as sanguine or phlegmatic, terms derived from the humour theory, we will start describing people as serotonic or norepinephric, a gain for science but a loss for poetry. Clearly we have too many causes here, leading us somewhere between the blind man and the elephant and \u201cDear Officer Krupke.\u201d Amazingly, they can all be true, applied to different people and different types of depression and/or the same person in different phases of depression. We human beings have neurotransmitters and we have relationships. We have memories and we process current reality. We have genetically transmitted structures and patterns and we suffer loss and trauma. All of these factors interact. To cite a rather sad example, trauma alters neurochemistry for the worse so that trauma is doubly registered as memory and as altered brain function. So an openness by both therapists and sufferers to a multiplicity of treatment approaches makes the best sense. As a victim of chronic depression, you know that none of the above have completely done the trick for you, even if they 50 have helped. Yet they probably haven\u2019t been totally useless. Or perhaps, sadly, they have been. The Psychodynamic Approach Let\u2019s start with the psychodynamic approach. Here, too, there is a range of approaches from the classical psychoanalytic five times a week on the couch to once a week face-to-face meetings. Psychodynamic treatment for depression generally is once or twice a week face to face. Sigmund Freud wrote a great paper, \u201cMourning and Melancholia,\u201d which has shaped the analytic-dynamic treatment of depression ever since. In it he contrasts a normal phenomenon, mourning, with a pathological one, melancholia, which we call depression. In both he hypothesizes"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_20", "text": "there has been a loss (of a person or an ideal or a job or a valued place in the world) resulting in little or no interest in the outside world. There is diminution of the capacity to love and painful affect. In mourning, what is lost is painfully conscious; in melancholia it often is not. In most cases of melancholia it is a mystery to both sufferer and observer what is being mourned, while it is obvious to all that the melancholic is mourning something. In Freud\u2019s account of it \u201csuccessful\u201d mourning requires intensely emotionally recalling memory after memory of the deceased until the photo album, so to speak, is exhausted. Mourning differs from 51 melancholia in that the mourner, as well as the observers, knows perfectly well what loss is being mourned. The intensity of the emotional connection to each memory breaks that emotional bond, somewhat like stretching a rubber band beyond its capacity snaps it. Just as the snapping rubber band inflicts pain as it recoils, the hyperemotional memory inflicts pain as it snaps. The end of a long process, the last tie\u2014the final memory\u2014is snapped, and mourning comes to an end. Reality has won, the loved one is no longer here, and reason dictates that we move on. But it\u2019s been a hard fight, absorbing all of the mourner\u2019s energy as he or she engages in what Freud called \u201cthe mourning work.\u201d Melancholia is different. Not only is what has been lost mysterious, but the process is baffling as well. Depressions are characterized in many ways. One of the most familiar and useful distinctions is between endogenous and exogenous depression. If someone tells you that he is deeply depressed, goes on to say that he has been fired, diagnosed with HIV, and his wife ran off with his best friend, we are not puzzled about his being depressed. This is an exogenous depression. On the other hand, if someone tells us she was walking home from work and started sobbing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, is only able to get home with tremendous effort, has felt helpless and hopeless ever since, and keeps 52 telling herself what an evil, worthless person she is, this is an endogenous depression and we are at a loss to understand or explain it. Chronic depressions are most often a mix, with the endogenous element predominating. Mourning comes to an end (normally) while melancholia (at least in the form of chronic depression) does not. Further, the melancholic suffers a precipitous loss of self-esteem not present in the mourner. Further, as you know all too well, a depressed (melancholic) person reviles him- or herself with the most vicious self-accusations. True, the mourner experiencing \u201csurvivor guilt\u201d does something of the same thing. But if the mourner\u2019s self-accusations persist, going beyond a certain point, he is no longer simply mourning: he is depressed. Freud tells us in a strange poetic way that in melancholia \u201cthe shadow of the object fell on the ego.\u201d What"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_21", "text": "does this mean? Well, to start with \u201cego\u201d here means self and the object is what is lost: a loved one, an ideal, status, whatever. But the melancholic, the depressed one, has poor boundaries, so the lost object and the self get confused and indeed the lost one is now part of the self. The internalization of the lost object in this process is totally or largely unconscious. In Freud\u2019s language, \u201can object relation\u201d (that is one between two separate people) becomes an 53 \u201cidentification\u201d (that is, now there is only one person, the self fused with the other). That\u2019s bad enough, but things get worse. The lost loved one is experienced as having abandoned the self and there is rage at that abandonment. Since the self and object are fused, rage against the abandoning other or abandoning value becomes rage against the self. That is one mechanism explaining depression as anger turned against the self. What follows are the terribly tormenting self-accusations you know only too well. Freud has much of this right. There is indeed an intimate relationship between mourning and melancholia-depression. In fact, some have hypothesized that one cause of depression is failure to mourn. This is congruent with my clinical experience. An important psychodynamic treatment of depression is facilitating belated mourning for old losses. Painful as that process is, it helps. Psychodynamic treatment does in general pay more attention to past wounds than other treatment modalities. This is never mere history; the past is only of therapeutic interest if it continues to influence the present, for example, by fueling depression. Since the unmourned losses are largely unconscious, dynamic psychotherapy works to make them conscious. This form of treatment also addresses the blurred or fused unconscious boundaries and seeks to 54 make them both conscious and more focused and distinct. Rendering anger more conscious and getting it out front, rather than turned against the self, is an important part of this process. Psychodynamic treatment also puts loss of self-esteem into strong focus and works to raise it. Analysts who followed Freud emphasized this loss of self-esteem as a central dynamic in depression and zero in on it in their treatments. Trauma is also central in the etiology of depression. So psychodynamic therapists, who are used to taking into account the influence of the past on the present, naturally turn to old, perhaps unconscious, trauma and try to bring it into the present so it can be worked through. The relationship between trauma and depression is complex. Depression is a symptom of trauma; repressed, unaddressed trauma causes depression; and depression is itself traumatizing. I shall return to the role of trauma in depression in the next chapter on the rehabilitation approach when I elaborate on the centrality of memory in mourning chronic depression. A unique aspect of psychodynamic therapy is that it utilizes the relationship between patient and therapist, or in technical terms, the 55 transference and countertransference, to re-create the conflicts that brought the patient to treatment"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_22", "text": "and, so to speak, bring them into the room. In that way, the past becomes the present and can be reworked and re-experienced. Disagreeing with the cognitive therapists, Freud argued that melancholics\u2019 self-accusations were only apparently irrational; in fact, they contained more than a grain of truth. So arguing with the depressed one that his or her thoughts are irrational, which he knows isn\u2019t true, would only make matters worse. Here the clash between the two schools couldn\u2019t be clearer. Can they both be right? I doubt it, but maybe there is a time to confront and a time to confirm. Freud also pointed out that the depressive\u2019s worldview, at least until it becomes overtly delusional, may well be more congruent with reality than that of the normal person. The only problem is that it is unlivable. We need a little Pollyanna to survive with a modicum of happiness, and, as you know, chronic depression isn\u2019t exactly Pollyannaish. Many psychodynamic therapists believe that sadness is an effective treatment for depression so they try to get their patients to stay with their conscious sadness in therapeutic doses. I heartily endorse this. 56 Psychodynamic therapists also look at the possible defensive purposes of depression\u2014is it a place to hide out\u2014a security operation? This can sound accusatory and elicit an angry response, yet it is worth looking at to see if any such dynamic contributes to your depression. Freud thought that the most recalcitrant force driving chronicity was the sufferer\u2019s belief that he or she doesn\u2019t deserve to recover, and that the painful symptoms are just punishment for sins real or imagined. Depression is a perfect whip for such self-flagellation; ironically (and tragically) depression can serve as a punishment for being depressed. Contemporary psychodynamic practitioners explore the ways in which conscious and unconscious guilt perpetuates the illness This is another dynamic worth looking at. Irrational guilt is so much a part of depression as both cause and effect that it may very well be contributing to your misery. To summarize psychodynamic treatment of depression: it focuses on making unconscious loss conscious; unconscious trauma conscious; firming up boundaries, conscious and unconscious, between self and other; raising self-esteem; and getting anger and aggression out front. 57 Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy takes a different tack. Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis are the big names here. It has little, if any, interest in the past or in the reasons the patient became depressed. Rather, the whole focus of the treatment is on the irrational, unrealistic beliefs that keep the depressed person depressed, for example, the belief that he is the worst person in the world, or that she is worthless, or that only getting by getting straight A\u2019s will she be lovable. Cognitive therapy challenges these clearly counterfactual beliefs, some of them self-accusations, some of them unreasonable, unfulfillable expectations. Its tools are confrontation, demonstration (of irrationality), and reeducation. Cognitive therapy importantly expands the depressed person\u2019s experience of the possible. It is all about getting out of the"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_23", "text": "self-imposed trap that constrictive, distorted thinking imposes. For example, the cognitive therapist would challenge the chronically depressed person\u2019s belief that things are hopeless, that the only light at the end of the tunnel is the locomotive. On the contrary, there are possibilities that the depression has blinded the depressed one to. In our example, you could lie flat on the center of the tracks, let the locomotive pass over you, or climb the ladder on the wall depression had blinded you to while the train passes, and then walk out of the tunnel. Or 58 to change the example, you might be convinced that girls with B+ averages find love too, and thereby lose your main reason for being depressed. The concept of learned helplessness as an explanation for depression isn\u2019t primarily cognitive but is related. In a famous experiment Martin Seligman placed dogs on a floor that could be electrified. When the shock was turned on the dogs were able to jump over a barrier and escape. When they relaxed in apparent safety, Seligman shocked them again. They then jumped back to the other side and were shocked again. Then they gave up and just sat there and whimpered. Then the conditions changed. There was no shock on the other side of the barrier and they could escape their pain. But they didn\u2019t even try. They had acquired what Seligman called \u201clearned helplessness,\u201d which he argued was an analog of human depression. Damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t, so why try? Seligman then had an assistant drag the dogs over the barrier to safety, then return them to the shock side. It took ten interventions before the dogs spontaneously jumped over the barrier to escape the shock and arrive at a safe place. From this Seligman argued that therapists treating depressed patients need to be highly active, dragging those dogs to safety and demonstrating that the possibility does indeed exist. Cognitive 59 therapists are extremely active; they do it verbally and symbolically but they too drag those dogs over the barrier to safety. Cognitive therapy has a very good record in treating acute depression. But its efficacy in treating the kind of depression you suffer is much less certain, indeed, highly questionable. Nevertheless, if you have no experience of cognitive therapy you have nothing to lose by trying it. Interpersonal Therapy Interpersonal psychotherapy also works with the present, but rather than trying to modify irrational beliefs, it examines and tries to modify the multidirectional interactions between the depressed person and his or her significant others. It postulates negative feedback loops that perpetuate or exacerbate the depression. For example, the depressed person infuriates his loved ones, who are, in effect, his caretakers, by refusing to take his antidepressant medications. They yell at him and call him a stubborn fool who is sabotaging himself despite them, all of which may be true. Their accusations confirm his self-accusations and make him feel even more hopeless, leaving him with no"}

By now he\u2019s sure he\u2019s hopeless and that they won\u2019t help anyway, and besides, he can at least get a mini-jolly by upsetting mother and 60 father. They, in turn, get even angrier and their accusations grow nastier. Round and round we go in an ever-declining spiral. The interpersonal therapist seeks to disrupt this negative feedback system by making it conscious through interpretation, confrontation, and demonstration, let us say by role-playing of alternate ways of communicating. In interpersonal psychotherapy, the past is not completely ignored. These counterproductive interactive feedback loops no doubt were operative at some level before the depression occurred and to some extent were etiological in its coming to be. That, too, can be interpreted, made conscious, and worked through. If your family is anything like the family I described above, an interpersonal therapist might be just the ticket. He or she probably won\u2019t cure your depression but could help mitigate the factors and communication systems that are exacerbating it. Often interpersonal therapy is most effective in dealing with the secondary consequences of the depression and less so, at least in the kind of chronic depression we\u2019re talking about here, in curing the depression itself. It nevertheless brings a powerful new lens to the understanding of any particular depression. 61 Back to Ron Smith How did this apply to Dr. Ron Smith whom we met in the last chapter? The psychodynamic therapist would view his or her first task as the establishment of rapport. Building the relationship between patient and therapist and using it therapeutically is at the core of psychodynamic treatment. Of course all therapists need to establish rapport with their client-patients, but the psychodynamic approach puts the relationship at the center of the treatment. How is this accomplished? Essentially by empathic, attentive, non-judgmental listening and engagement, by what the counseling theorist Carl Rogers called \u201cunconditional positive regard.\u201d This would be particularly salient working with Ron Smith, who is so filled with shame and has experienced so many high-volume condemnations, especially, but not only, after his breakdown. The therapeutic alliance between patient and therapist provides safety, hopefully a sufficiently secure sense that the therapist\u2019s office is a safe place for the patient, here Dr. Smith. This feeling of being in a safe place makes it possible for the patient to experience and share extremely painful memories and equally painful stuff occurring in the present. The whole idea is to open things up, thereby opening up Ron and relieving the constriction that became so emotionally disabling after he descended into 62 the depressive pit. Along the same lines, Ron suffered horribly from isolation, aloneness, and loneliness, as well as feelings of not being part of the human race. Establishing a strong therapeutic alliance provides a form of community and Ron\u2019s experience is no longer solely that of a loner. In the psychodynamic approach the relationship is used in yet another way. In the course of time, many of Ron\u2019s conflicts would be enacted"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_25", "text": "in the therapy and his maladaptive defenses made manifest. This could be commented on (interpreted) by the therapist and worked on. For example, Ron exacerbates his loneliness by pushing people away and/or avoiding them. An instance would be his not responding to holiday greetings from old army buddies. The therapist would certainly call this to his attention, but better yet, Ron might enact his avoidance behavior, motivated by fear and shame, by missing the session immediately after a particularly emotionally connective one. The technical term for this reenactment is transference. The therapist would interpret the transference something like this: \u201cRon, you told me that you were feeling close to me after I connected with your despair during your breakdown in our last session two weeks ago. Then you didn\u2019t call and didn\u2019t show last week. I think there\u2019s a connection there. You\u2019re so hungry for some human 63 understanding. Yet when you get it you flee. That\u2019s worth talking about.\u201d After such an intervention, all kinds of things\u2014feelings\u2014might open up, like Ron\u2019s wish for yet fear of closeness and the feelings of worthlessness and shame that make him flee. The psychodynamic approach deals more with the past than the other approaches do, although it certainly doesn\u2019t neglect the present. It is particularly interested in trauma and loss. We know that depression is a symptom of trauma and that depression itself further traumatizes. And we know that ancient traumas, long secreted away from consciousness, can continue to depress. Of course loss can be traumatic and often is the central trauma in people\u2019s lives. The psychodynamic approach isn\u2019t interested in the past as history; it is interested in the past when it continues to influence or even determines the present. The psychodynamic therapist seeks to increase conscious awareness using all of the tools available. One such tool is dream interpretation. Patients are encouraged to report and explore their dreams, hopefully opening up new avenues of awareness. Depression itself powerfully influences what and how we dream. Just as depression can constrict conscious life, it can also impoverish and constrict the unconscious life expressed in dreams. At 64 first Ron Smith reported few dreams. It was only over a period of years that his dream life became available for us to work with. The psychodynamic therapist would at one point challenge, or at least probe, Ron\u2019s reportedly happy childhood. There was just too much disturbance in his family: witness the suicide of one sibling and the drug overdose death of another for that to be entirely credible. Depressed people are often accused of \u201cseeing through a glass darkly,\u201d retrospectively distorting and/or exaggerating their negative experiences, particularly their childhood ones. There is some empirical evidence that this is true. Nevertheless, my experience is rather the opposite, namely that people who suffer chronic depression engage in what I call retrospective idealization. Actually the proclivity towards distortion of memory works both ways, perhaps exaggerating the horrors of the past while paradoxically just as frequently repainting it with"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_26", "text": "rose-colored paint. Psychodynamic therapists, including me, would be suspicious of those who see through rose-colored glasses. The reason all of this is important is that confronting real historical pain can indeed lighten or ameliorate depression. Ron\u2019s depression was softened by our reimagining his childhood in more realistic and darker terms. 65 There is also evidence that \u201cdepressives,\u201d at least up to a point, actually see the world more accurately than the non-depressed. There was a bumper sticker around a few years ago that read, \u201cShit, more shit, then you die.\u201d This does indeed encapsulate one aspect of reality, one that really exists and that the depressed person focuses on. Of course that\u2019s not the whole story. Back to Ron. It may be that before his breakdown his hapistat\u2014that hypothetical entity some theorists think is \u201cpreset\u201d to an equilibrium point by heredity\u2014was naturally high, giving him immunity to whatever in his childhood home doomed his two siblings. But I doubt it. There was simply too much depression in the family and Ron\u2019s long history of depression has to be connected to some pretty grim stuff early in his life. Our hypothetical psychodynamic therapist would certainly want to know about those childhood enemas and the feelings and fantasies associated with them. My guess is that they were traumatic and that the adolescent self-administered enema was an attempt to master that trauma by reliving it, turning a passive experience into an active one. Such an interpretation, typical of dynamic therapy, would serve to normalize or at last explain the source of shame and self-loathing, thereby softening one 66 of the consistent and most punishing elements of Ron\u2019s depression. I could go on, but you get the idea. Cognitive therapy stays in the present. Cognitive therapists would confront, challenge, and demonstrate the irrationality of many of Ron\u2019s present beliefs, beliefs that had gotten him depressed and are keeping him there, for example, his conviction that he is \u201cworthless\u201d or that his life has been a \u201ccomplete waste.\u201d The cognitive therapist would try to convince Ron that such beliefs are counterfactual, at variance with reality. Take worthlessness. \u201cWere you worthless when you were helping your outpatients in the army? How about the help you gave the inpatients before you got sick? What about the way you supported your mother during her declining years? How about the courage you showed when you repeated your first year of graduate school and went on to a doctorate?\u201d Ron would no doubt argue, but the cognitive therapist would keep at it. \u201cYou generalize, distorting reality. Your life hasn\u2019t been a complete waste\u2014look at the things you\u2019ve accomplished. You yourself told me that you were a good therapist. How about that?\u201d The therapist might go on: \u201cIf you broke your leg and couldn\u2019t run a four-minute mile because of that, would you hate yourself? Depression is a disease and its effect on you is much like an injury. Just like the broken 67 leg would slow you down, depression does"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_27", "text": "the same thing. To blame yourself for being sick\u2014for having a disease\u2014is irrational. It makes things worse than they have to be.\u201d Cognitive therapists also assign homework, teach coping strategies, encourage action, educate about depression and its causes, and persistently, gently, and determinedly challenge the irrational thoughts maintaining the depression. They use techniques like \u201cthought-stopping,\u201d that is, instructing a patient to \u201ctalk back\u201d to the inner voice telling him he\u2019s worthless, literally saying \u201cshut up, leave me alone,\u201d role-playing non-depressed behaviors, and suggesting other ways of thinking. It all helps. Unfortunately, it\u2019s most helpful in acute depression. Still, it has something to offer in chronic depression. If it \u201conly\u201d loosens one obsessive self-hating thought, it has done something significant. Then you would be, to some extent, less deeply depressed. The interpersonal approach encourages examining here-and-now interactions with other people that contribute to maintain depression. If Ron had consulted an interpersonal therapist during the period when he was having his breakdown, the therapist would have zeroed in on his relationships with his commanding officer, with his peers, with other hospital personnel, and with his patients. What sort of negative feedback 68 loops were operating? For example, as Ron started feeling depressed he chose to work with the sickest patients, who frequently confirmed his growing belief that he was inadequate at best and useless at worst as a therapist. His already vey sick patients then being treated by a self- doubting depressed psychologist would be even less likely to improve, confirming Ron\u2019s belief that he was useless. Panic was not far behind. The interpersonal therapist would make manifest this negative feedback loop and seek to disrupt it, perhaps by telling Ron that he needed to work with patients with better prognoses if he wanted to feel better, and then help him work through these fears of being inadequate with higher functioning patients so he could get some positive feedback. Interpersonal therapy looks at the internalized feedback loops, the interpersonally destructive tapes imprinted by past experience that both cause and maintain depression. But its focus is on the present, including the interplay with the therapist. If Ron had consulted an interpersonal therapist after he returned home from the service and was subjected to relentless criticism for \u201claziness and malingering,\u201d the therapist might have suggested family therapy and helping Ron see the angry, \u201cpassive- aggressive\u201d component of his nonfunctioning, while helping the family to see that they were just making things worse by berating Ron and telling 69 them that if they backed off he might do better. Their rage at Ron\u2019s disease had become rage at him, and if they could see that dynamic, some improvement might have been possible. All three psychotherapeutic approaches have their uses. All of them are helpful with the right patient at the right time. None of them \u201ccure\u201d chronic depression, although they may make it more tolerable. I believe that regardless of \u201cschool\u201d or \u201ctechnique,\u201d the most important predictor of therapeutic success is the relationship. I advise"}

There is some professional out there who can be a force for good in your life and that is worth having. Depression is a bio-social-psychological phenomenon. Biological vulnerability, inborn or acquired through traumatization, including the traumatization of major depression itself, interacts with the social surround that often contributes depressive forces, perhaps in response to the depressed one\u2019s behavior, such as rejection, unrealistic expectations and demands, and lacerating criticism, which in turn interact with internal saboteurs, self-hating self-concepts, and overidentification with now gone and/or malignant people in the sufferer\u2019s present or past life. All of these continually reinforce each other, resulting in either continuing plunging into the darkness or keeping you stuck there. No 70 wonder you feel awful. You just can\u2019t find anything that you can do to make it better. Any decent treatment of chronic depression addresses each and every contributing factor enumerated above with appropriate means: pharmacological, somatic, social, and psychological. 71 Chapter 3: The Rehabilitation Approach This is a short chapter that I hope will have a powerful impact. You have been and are suffering from chronic depression. Chronic depression is a disability. If you had pneumonia and recovered, we would not say that you suffer from a chronic illness or that you are disabled. On the other hand, if you develop obstructive pulmonary syndrome, we would say that you suffer from a chronic illness and that you are disabled by it and that would be true. It is similar with depression. If you suffer from acute depression, however severe, and recover, common sense would say that you have been ill and now you are well, and that would be the case. Chronic depression isn\u2019t like that. Though it may give you intervals of remission, it just doesn\u2019t go away. It pervades your life, affects your moods, your vocation, your bodily health, and your relationships. Having chronic depression does not mean that you are actively depressed every moment of your life. You even may have moments of joy, and at times have strong interests and be highly emotionally invested in various activities and relationships. What it does mean, and this is the bad news, is that a great deal of the time you are sub-par and at times feel 72 just plain awful. Even during good stretches, there\u2019s that terrifying dread of going back into a black hole. Worse yet, that can really happen. If living with such a constellation of woe doesn\u2019t constitute a disability, I don\u2019t know what does. It\u2019s not easy to hear that you are disabled, that you have a disability that however well you manage it, is going to follow you like a shadow. That is indeed bad news whatever way you look at it. But there is some good news. Recognizing the daunting fact that you are disabled opens up possibilities of coming to terms with that disability and coping with it in ways hitherto"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_29", "text": "you\u2019ve not even imagined. Unfortunately, this is not a case of the truth making you free, but the truth does to some, maybe even a considerable, extent, free you up. This is a chapter whose aim is to help you face the truth about your condition and to suggest ways to come to terms with it, ways to minimize its impact on your life. As we have seen, chronic depression has many causes, among them your temperament. Some temperaments predispose to depression. If you\u2019re on the obsessive side, that also predisposes to depression. You didn\u2019t choose your temperament, which is largely a genetic given. Then there are your genetically determined neurotransmitters. You didn\u2019t choose them either. There are also the powerful effects of both early and 73 current trauma. Trauma is cumulative. It can pile up to a breaking point. And as we\u2019ve noted, depression itself is traumatizing. Trauma is recorded not only in memory, but as altered brain structure and function. You didn\u2019t choose any of that either. Realizing and coming to truly believe that you didn\u2019t cause your disability\u2014your ongoing depression\u2014has the potential to alleviate at least some of the torment and guilt so intrinsic to depression. Now you don\u2019t have to feel guilty about being sick, that is, about being depressed\u2014although you have long felt such guilt, which can be truly tormenting\u2014any more than you could justifiably feel guilty about being paralyzed from polio. You aren\u2019t responsible for your depression; you are responsible for treating it to the max and coping as well as you can with the untreatable residue. Taking action is one of the best antidepressants. It breaks the feelings of hopelessness and helplessness so intrinsic to the disease. Doing all you can to treat your illness and taking steps to cope with the part that is not amenable to treatment is taking action\u2014taking a strong action. It will definitely help soften those horrible feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. You may have had difficulty identifying with Ron Smith, whose depression was so radically impoverishing. You are about to meet two 74 people whose depressions are no less chronic, yet have permitted them fuller lives in which vocational accomplishment and satisfying relationships have been possible. It is likely that you will find it easier to identify with them. Margaret I had known Margaret for many years. The most recent exacerbation of her chronic depression was truly horrific. It recalled the tormented young woman I met so many years ago. She came to me unemployed, undereducated, and desperate. She manifested those twin signs of depression I just suggested that action ameliorates: feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Margaret\u2019s childhood had been bleak at best. Her father drank heavily and was extremely nasty, angry, and bitter when in his cups.

Her demeanor was that of one who was terrorized. In the course of our work she got in touch with a traumatic memory of the night her drunken father had violated her. She 75 was six. At an unconscious level she \u201cknew\u201d that she had entered therapy to bring to consciousness her sexual abuse by her father. That was the source of her terror. She believed that he \u201cwould know\u201d that she had told and would kill her. That, of course, was a displacement of the terror in response to her father\u2019s threats when she was six. Margaret was in no way psychotic; yet her conviction that her now elderly, sick, rather pathetic father would \u201cknow\u201d and kill her was close to crazy. Once her trauma was conscious we worked with all its associated emotions: sorrow, fear, rage, powerlessness, shame, and paradoxically, as is common in those abused as children, guilt. That work helped, and months of emotional catharsis seemed to pay off. Yet her terror remained. Then we got a break. Her father suddenly died, which was transforming. Margaret not only felt better, she looked different. She even smiled from time to time. Her parents fought continuously, yet another traumatization, and her mother, her only refuge, started drinking herself, and at one point abandoned the family, driving off in a rage. She returned several weeks later, but that didn\u2019t undo the terror of being alone with the drunken father. Her three older siblings, all boys, had left by then. Neither in childhood nor down to the present had the children been close. 76 By some miracle, Margaret managed to marry a decent man who loved her, as she does him. Her marriage is the best thing in her life. Margaret sort of had two mothers: a sober, kind, supportive one, and a drunken, depressed, abandoning one. I told her that she had been lucky enough to marry her \u201cgood mother\u201d and she agreed. In normal development children generally fuse and integrate their experiences of bad and good mother; this is part of healthy maturation.

She found a job in the purchasing department of a local university and studied at a community college, receiving her associate degree with honors. She was no longer depressed, nor was she living in terror. When she terminated therapy, I thought I had a cure. I was wrong. Margaret has since suffered repeated episodes of depression of varying severity. The last was the worst. Making the best use she could of her depression-free, or relatively free interludes, Margaret made a career for herself at the university.

Margaret returned for ongoing psychotherapy several years after her termination and that has been sustaining. She has also had good fortune in working with a creative psychiatrist who cares about her, always 78 scrambling to find a new combination of meds that would be effective when the old ones failed. To return to Margaret\u2019s most recent episode of acute depression: it was triggered by a change in upper management in her department. After feeling proud and autonomous on the job, her new micromanaging boss undermined all she had gained. Constantly criticized, controlled, and made to feel inadequate, she became filled with rage and shame. She grew more and more depressed, finally going out on disability. The loss of status, purpose, and source of self-worth was devastating for her. She blamed herself in spades. She was fearful of running into people she had known on the job. Shame and guilt became her constant companions. Not for the first time, Margaret seriously contemplated suicide. Suicide frequently becomes a serious option for the chronically depressed. It probably has for you. Should you commit suicide? I can\u2019t decide that for you, but I do have some thoughts about it. Suicide is attractive as an escape from suffering; it is often an expression of almost infinite rage, and it can be a consequence of the distorted thinking caused by the disease itself. Let\u2019s look at these in more detail. 79 Euthanasia as an escape from hopeless, unendurable physical suffering is increasingly acceptable and in fact it is legal in some states. Some have argued that the pain of intractable depression is parallel to such bodily suffering and ending it by taking one\u2019s life\u2014with or without assistance\u2014should be an available option. I don\u2019t disagree. However, chronic depression is different from terminal cancer. First, there are now new and better treatments being developed and hope of at least partial recovery is not unrealistic, as it well might be"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_32", "text": "in the case of terminal cancer. The severity of depression varies, going up and down, so making an irreversible decision during an episode of exacerbation needs to be extensively questioned. The possibility isn\u2019t going to be taken away from you, so there\u2019s no need to act now. Think it through. Then think it through again. Then there is suicide as an expression of rage. Fuck \u2019em all. Margaret certainly had an unconscious target in her boss when she was thinking of ending it. Rage of which you are unconscious is not a good or adequate reason to kill yourself. So ask yourself, being as honest as possible, if you would be \u201csuiciding\u201d at somebody. Preferably do that exploration with a therapist. As you know, depression can be viewed as anger turned inward, and getting in contact with unconscious, internalized rage may 80 save your life. There are better ways of getting revenge than killing yourself. Besides, it isn\u2019t very effective. In all probability, your intended target\u2014conscious or unconscious\u2014will be little affected by your choice and will soon forget all about you. You do need to factor in the likelihood that your depression is distorting your thinking. Again, it\u2019s a good time to talk it over with someone like a competent therapist. Finally, there is suicide motivated by sheer exhaustion. \u201cI just can\u2019t do this anymore. It\u2019s going on for too long.\u201d This one is really dangerous. Nobody can tell you whether or not your struggle is worth it, but the likelihood is that it is. Again, think it through and talk it over. Margaret is enraged. Mostly she is enraged at her depression itself. \u201cThis fucking thing has made my whole life a struggle.\u201d It certainly has. And you too have every right to be furious at the fate that gave you your predisposition to depression. Margaret is also angry at the people who traumatized her, but she is much less so than she used to be. She tells me, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the childhood stuff anymore. I\u2019ve pretty much worked that through during the many years of therapy with you. I\u2019ve even forgiven my parents for the things they did, if not for the genes they gave me.\u201d This is mostly true. She is now fully conscious of the anger she feels at 81 her last boss, whose sadistic behavior triggered her current depression. The more she feels her anger, the less her shame and guilt. Our work in making her anger conscious and the opportunity to express it in therapy has paid off. Kindling, discussed above, has certainly contributed to both the presence and severity of her latest episode. The danger of kindling doing its sub rosa terrible work is an excellent reason to stay on medication and in therapy. Fortunately, there is a countervailing force to kindling. There is substantial empirical evidence that people tend to be happier as they grow older. Some, maybe most, of the sturm und drang of life is past, and people often grow"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_33", "text": "to accept and enjoy the place where they have arrived. I don\u2019t know if this applies to advanced old age, but it does seem to characterize late middle and early old age. Does this apply to those, like you, who suffer chronic depression? We don\u2019t know. There are no research studies in this area. But it may. Our friend, Dr. Ron Smith, is a case in point. He is happier now, late in his life, than he has ever been. In spite of the wasted years consequent upon his disease, he is mostly content. Is this the manifestation of his depression \u201cburning out\u201d? Is there such a thing? I don\u2019t think we know, but perhaps. 82 In spite of recurring suicidal thoughts, Margaret has not given up. She is readjusting her meds once again; she is continuing in therapy; and she is exploring the possibility of TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). George George is a sculptor. His depression is also lifelong, but much less unremitting. He has had long periods of relative normality during which he is free of major depression, if not entirely free of the less ominous dysthymia. His depressions have been intertwined with heavy drinking, which has been both cause and consequence of it. That is, his depression has been gravely exacerbated by his drinking, even as his depression has triggered futile attempts to ameliorate it with alcohol. George has been sober and an active member of A.A. for several years, and he is much less depressed. George\u2019s mother was a severely depressed woman who withdrew from life and lived out essentially inert, hopeless years, waiting to die. His father was little present and chiefly involved in running his farm. George\u2019s deepest fear is becoming like his mother. His was a lonely childhood. His best and almost only friend was his brother. When they were both in their early twenties Larry was killed in a hunting accident. 83 Larry had been the father\u2019s favorite and the father, too, fell into a profound depression after the death of his son. George never really recovered from these twin losses. His father, as little present as he had been, was the more available of the two parents and he was no longer really there, and of course Larry was dead. Loss in general and unresolved or incomplete mourning are major dynamics in depression, and much of my work with George is focused on helping him mourn his brother. You can\u2019t mourn behind an addiction and George anesthetized the pain of his loss with alcohol without resolving anything as he grew ever more depressed. As he was able to do some mourning in our therapeutic work together, his depression to some extent lifted. At another point in our work when George was in one of his lows, I reflected that he was in a really awful place. He got angry and pushed back, snapping, \u201cNot awful, uncomfortable.\u201d And then he smiled. That was a turning point in dealing with that particular depressive"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_34", "text": "episode. George\u2019s getting angry really helped. A high school art teacher recognized his talent and George won a scholarship to a top art school. He did well, graduated, and moved to Chicago. His career has been up and down. Failing to get commissions, getting bad reviews of shows, and losing competitions have all triggered major depressions. In spite of this, 84 George has succeeded in making a living as a sculptor, not, to say the least, an easy thing to do. But he has never been the major figure he believes he deserves to be. I\u2019m not in a position to evaluate his talent, but I have no reason to doubt that he is every bit as good as he says he is. That piece of George does not sound depressed, although it may be compensatory. He has a great deal of rage over not being in the snobbish and highly restricted circle of fashionable sculptors who get commission after commission. This is an ongoing torment for him. Should I advise him to lower his expectations? A cognitive therapist would. But I am inhibited by not knowing how major a talent his is, and even if it is not, the belief may be sustaining, albeit disappointing. George has had a series of long-term affairs but never married. He loses sexual interest after a while and intercourse becomes sporadic. In his words, \u201cI spice things up with an occasional visit to a prostitute. I don\u2019t consider this cheating\u2014there\u2019s no emotion involved.\u201d His girlfriend probably knows and looks the other way. He feels loved by her, a feeling he reciprocates, and their \u201carrangement\u201d seems to work. 85 After we\u2019d been working together for several years, George told me, with much shame, that he occasionally deliberately wet his sheet with his urine, rocked himself in it, and fell asleep, deeply content and at peace. At first we understood this as a regression to infancy or early childhood when his mother, not yet chronically depressed, would dry and comfort him. That was true. But then I had another thought that understood this strange behavior as a way of releasing bottled up feelings, particularly those of grief. I said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re weeping through your penis,\u201d an interpretation he immediately grasped. That opened up new possibilities for mourning, and soon George wept copious tears for his tragically lost brother. He has not wrapped himself in urine-wet sheets since. What is the take-home message from George\u2019s chronic depression? Alcohol is the worst possible anti-depressant, in fact, it is a depressant; unresolved mourning majorly contributes to depression, and bottled up feelings do too. George is definitely doing better. Yet he remains, and probably will remain, vulnerable to serious depressive episodes triggered by loss, disappointed aspirations, and perceived failure to receive the recognition and respect he believes he deserves. George knows all this and as painful as his depressions are, he pretty much accepts having to live with this vulnerability. 86 Suggestions for Therapists and Families Let me"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_35", "text": "address a few words to therapists treating chronic depression. First, depression is contagious (this applies even more strongly to those who live with a chronically depressed person). If you treat much depression, you are in danger of getting depressed yourself. I\u2019m not sure that you can altogether avoid this, but some things help. Get a few manic patients, or better yet, patients without mood disorders. But I think the essential trick is to not buy into your patients\u2019 despair without denying that despair. Not an easy trick. Neither an optimist nor a pessimist be. Rather, be as much a realist as you can. Access your own feelings of rage, helplessness, and hopelessness and try to use them therapeutically. Allow yourself to identify with the depressed patients\u2014all too easy to do\u2014without losing your own identity\u2014that\u2019s not easy at all. Get some therapy for yourself. Working with a supervisor or being in a supervision group is another plus. Perhaps most importantly, get out of the office and do some crazy enjoyable things that have absolutely nothing to do with depression. Go to the opera. Go to a nude beach. Do whatever you need to do to not become the lifeguard who drowns. How about family members? They\u2019re in a much worse situation than therapists who work a lot with depression. After all, the therapist can go 87 to his or her own therapist and/or go mountain climbing, attend a symphony, travel in Antarctica, and generally enjoy life when he or she isn\u2019t doing therapy. That\u2019s not so easily possible for family members who are living with a chronically and severely depressed person. As I said above, depression is contagious. It evokes feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. It also evokes much intense rage. Remember Ron Smith\u2019s family. They sounded cruel and indeed they were, but their response is also understandable. Ron, however much he could not help being in the situation he was in, was nevertheless infuriating. This kind of family dynamic needs some professional help. I would strongly recommend family therapy. As a family member dealing with a loved one\u2019s chronic misery, you might also consider therapy for yourself. But mostly I think it helps to understand that your loved one has a disease, and though the sufferer does have some freedom of action, in many ways that disease does restrict his or her options in ways that person cannot change. There is also enormous sadness involved here. Seeing someone you love suffer so persistently and lose so much of life\u2019s potential can be and usually is heartbreaking. So you have a whole basket of really painful feelings to deal with. Don\u2019t underestimate the depths of your own suffering elicited 88 by sharing life and loving a chronically depressed parent, child, sibling, or mate. Accepting and Working Through \u201cAll right already. Let therapists take care of themselves and the siblings can go hang. I have enough trouble of my own. Enough, Dr. Levin. So now I know I have a chronic disability."}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_36", "text": "What the hell good does that do me?\u201d Perhaps a lot. How does one adjust to a physical disability? I know the analogy isn\u2019t perfect, for your core self is involved in a way it usually is not in a physical disability with an emotional disability such as chronic depression. Even worse, the very tools you need in order to adjust are compromised by your disease. Nevertheless, let\u2019s borrow some thoughts from the adjustment to physical disability literature. What does it suggest? First, think of yourself as more able than disabled. Think about what you can do, particularly in the area of the emotional, rather than what you can\u2019t do. That doesn\u2019t mean denying your disability. But it does mean recognizing and embracing your emotional strengths. Do you have the capacity to love, for example? Have you shown courage in dealing with this damned disease? Are you able to work? Are you able to make 89 contributions to others\u2019 welfare? Do you have moments of joy, however fleeting? Moments of wonder and awe? Moments of aesthetic bliss? Times when you are creative? I can go on, but it\u2019s better for you if you make your own list. And remember, your disease still is telling you that you are no damn good and good for nothing. Talk back to that voice; it is the counsel of despair. A closely related, very helpful strategy is to avoid identifying with your disease. You are not your depression; you have depression, just as you would not be your arthritis if you had arthritis. So insofar as possible, separate your true self from your disease. Try to get as much as possible out of life in spite of your depression. Grab on to your free, or relatively free, interludes and ride them for all they\u2019re worth. Even in your times in the pit, there are probably possibilities for pleasure out there, if not in this moment, perhaps in the next one. Try to be aware of the times when your thoughts aren\u2019t truly your own; rather, they\u2019re your disease speaking. When you identify that foreign voice talk back to it! Get as much distance from it as you can! Be as open to and as nonjudgmental of your feelings as you can possibly be. Try to stay with the discomfort accompanying many of them. 90 Stay in psychotherapy. It may not cure, but it most certainly helps. Work with a psychiatrist who is not only a competent and creative psychopharmacologist but is also a human being who cares about you and isn\u2019t afraid to express that caring. Encourage your psychiatrist to keep up with the latest treatment advances and discuss their applicability to your situation with you. Painful as it can be, try to stay with the trauma work you are doing with your therapist. All of the above helps, but the core of the rehabilitation approach is mourning your chronic depression itself. That, of course, doesn\u2019t preclude mourning other losses in your life, which"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_37", "text": "is just as therapeutically vital. How does one mourn a disability that takes so much away and lies so close to your core self? There\u2019s no magic formula, but K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s well-known stages of grief come to mind. For all the apparent complexity, mourning your depression is quite simply grieving for it. K\u00fcbler-Ross describes a process starting with denial. The whole thrust of this book is to break down your denial. Nevertheless, it will come and go, sometimes mercifully protecting you, other times radically impeding your capacity to come to terms with your situation. Next comes anger. We\u2019ve discussed rage at the depression itself. Let yourself feel it in all its intensity. Express it in any non-self-destructive way you can. 91 Then, if possible, and only when you\u2019re fully ready, try to let it go. Then comes bargaining. \u201cDear God, if You\u2019ll only lift my depression, I will stop beating my wife.\u201d An absurd example, perhaps, but you get the idea. Bargain in any way that feels right to you until you realize the futility of that bargaining. The realization is likely to drop you into the next and most painful step: depression. This is the depression over being depressed that we have discussed. Don\u2019t criticize yourself for being depressed about your depression; it is natural and inevitable. You don\u2019t want to stay there. Yet you need to experience that secondary depression. K\u00fcbler-Ross was wrong about the stages being sequential and the sequence being linear. The reality is that the stages occur in many different orders and that the normal pattern is to oscillate back and forth, let\u2019s say, between acceptance and bargaining or depression and anger. So in the course of mourning either past losses or your depression itself, you will pass through each of these stages many times and in many different orders. But all this is a necessary process, a part of the mourning work which will, at some point, come to an end. At this point it is useful to remember that \u201csadness is a feeling; depression is as disease.\u201d Try to weep for the deprivations your depression has imposed on you. Stay sad as long as you need to. This is 92 not the sadness that is a symptom of depression; rather it is curative (however imperfectly). And finally, coming out of being depressed about depression, or better, feeling sad that you are depressed, you will have an opportunity to reach some sort of acceptance of your disability. Now you know what you have to live with and have some inkling of the positive possibilities underlying that \u201chave to.\u201d Using that knowledge to accept this ongoing reality of your life changes things. Hopefully, you will experience the Zen paradox that to accept is somehow to transmute. Acceptance is the key. I can\u2019t tell you how or what form it will take. That is an individual thing, but I have seen it happen. Acceptance truly is a deal changer. It does not mean ceasing by every possible"}
{"id": "living_with_chronic_depression_38", "text": "means to ameliorate your depression; rather it means accepting the present reality, even as you seek to change it. The Dialectic of Acceptance and Hope As I was looking for a way to finish this book, I happened to read Elie Wiesel\u2019s Open Heart, an account, among other things, of his triple bypass operation. It is not a book about depression, but something Wiesel says in it seemed to me to be highly applicable to living with chronic depression. Wiesel tells us that after Auschwitz, which he survived, he thought that never again would wars, hatred, racism, or anti-Semitism be 93 possible. He found out that he was wrong. As he says, after Cambodia, Rwanda and Bosnia, he realized that man had learned nothing. That nearly led him to despair. But it didn\u2019t. That side of Wiesel is a hard- headed realist who accepts humanity with all its flaws and all its potential for radical evil. Yet, he goes on to tell us that each day he says with Maimonides, the twelfth-century sage who wrote this prayer, \u201cThough He tarries, I believe in the coming of the Messiah.\u201d What Wiesel is saying is that somehow we must accomplish the daunting task of accepting the reality of pain without losing hope in a better future. For our purposes (whether we be Jews, for whom the Messiah has not come, or Christians, for whom He has), belief in the coming of the Messiah is not belief in a person or an event. Rather, it is a manifestation of hope. In the case of chronic depression, there can be hope that a sustained period of remission will occur, that the disease will burn itself out, or that a new and effective treatment or pharmacological cure will come into being. This leads me to conclude that the best that can be done to come to terms with chronic depression is to participate in a dialectic between acceptance and hope, a dialectic that denies the reality of neither of its polarities, seeing them as complementary and intertwined. As difficult as it is, try to position yourself within, or better yet, take within yourself this 94 dialectic of acceptance and hope. It has the potential to make living with chronic depression at least tolerable, and in the best of cases, considerably better than tolerable. 95 About the Author Jerome D.
