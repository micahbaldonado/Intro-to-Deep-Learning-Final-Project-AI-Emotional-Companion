Sachar M.D., FACP, MACG, AGAF ABOUT THE AUTHOR David Sachar was the first Dr. Burrill B. Crohn Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine from 1992-1999, when he also held the positions of vice chairman of the Department of Medicine (1991-99) and Director of the Dr. Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology at The Mount Sinai Medical Center (1983-99). He is now Director Emeritus of the GI Division. In 2005 he was granted a three-year Arnold P. Gold Foundation Professorship and in 2010 he was named a Master Educator in the Institute for Medical Education. Dr. Sachar was an honors graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. While working as a research associate with the U.S. Public Health Service in Bangladesh, Dr. Sachar played a role in the development of oral rehydration therapy for cholera and other diarrheal diseases, an advance credited with saving millions of lives each year, and one which in 2004 The Lancet referred to as \u201cprobably the greatest medical innovation of the 20th century.\u201d He was until recently a Captain (Medical Director grade) and Associate Recruiter in the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, in which capacity he served a month of active duty in Texas, Sept-Oct. 2005, to assist with hurricane relief efforts. After completing his medical residency at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital and his GI Fellowship at The Mount Sinai Hospital, he went on to become a specialist in inflammatory bowel disease, a field in which he has approximately 250 publications. He chaired the Research Development Committee of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, served on the Foundation's National Scientific Advisory Committee, and was the recipient of its Distinguished Service Award in 1991. A founding director of the Burrill B. Crohn Research Foundation, he is also the first American to have been elected Chairman of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. In 2002, Dr. Sachar was elected a Master of the American College of Gastroenterology; in 2003 he was elected a Patron Member of the Brazilian Association for Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn\u2019s Disease; and in 2005 he was named a Fellow of the American Gastroenterological"}

{"id": "adhd_1498592607_2", "text": "not good enough. It\u2019s \u201cAchieving Success with ADHD.\u201d We\u2019re going to succeed, and we\u2019re going to do it with ADHD firmly on board. We\u2019re not shaking it off; we\u2019re going to achieve success with it. This book is about how to do it. At least, it\u2019s about how I did it; and I figure if I could do it, anybody can do it. I say that because my case was a really bad one. It was forcing me to pull all-nighters; it was sending me into panics and tailspins; it was gnawing away at my marriage. I say that also because I believe, immodestly, I have achieved success. I\u2019m not going to describe that success here, though; you can read the book jacket to see what the publisher says about it. But we need to get one thing straight before we begin. This book is going to describe tricks and tactics, strategies and systems, all based on behavioral modification. I can absolutely testify that behavioral modification works\u2014but it rarely if ever works all by itself. It certainly didn\u2019t for me. In fact, for behavioral modification to even begin to make a dent in ADHD, it usually needs to invoke the help of the M-word. No, I don\u2019t mean \u201cmodification\u201d or \u201cmotivation\u201d; I mean medication. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. ADHD is a brain disorder, not a manifestation of weak will or original sin. Certain brain pathways are not being activated properly by the chemicals they depend on. Behavioral modification can help find alternate pathways, but pharmacology is usually required to provide the right chemicals in the right amounts. Let me tell you a bit about my story to make the point. From my 20s to my 40s, I was flying off the handle, shouting at my kids, being hyper-defensive with my wife, eating myself up with anxieties at work. It was worse than just ADHD; there was neurosis stirred heavily into the brew. Hence, three solid courses of psychotherapy: insights into distorted family values, impaired self- image, insecurities, inferiorities, yadda-yadda-yadda. After three courses of good old-fashioned talk therapy with some of the best practitioners in the business, I was much less of a monster and my wife and kids were tolerating me a lot better. But I was still driving like a maniac, still forgetting things whenever I left the house, still running late for appointments, still unable to stop agonizing over details, and still having trouble getting organized and finishing jobs in a timely fashion. In other words, I still had ADHD. Since I was smashing up the car too often, and didn\u2019t think I needed more driver\u2019s education. I figured out that maybe I should go to an ADHD expert. I found a real expert, who specialized in psychopharmacology. He administered a 10-item questionnaire and promptly confirmed the diagnosis. So first to control my impulsivity, so maddeningly and expensively exhibited behind the wheel, he prescribed Strattera\u00ae. Terrific! I stopped having auto accidents, my wife was no longer so fearful"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_3", "text": "of driving with me, and it took only a little while for me to figure out how to cope with the bladder side effects of the medication. OK; impulsivity better but obsessive-compulsive behavior still running loose. Hence, next step, Celexa\u00ae. Another milestone! No more fussing, fixating, ruminating, perseverating. But I was still having trouble focusing and concentrating. No problem; just sprinkle in some Concerta\u00ae. Bingo! Now, like Mary Poppins, I was practically perfect in every way. But not all the way perfect. I was still distractible and still having trouble getting my act together. In other words, I still had ADHD. What to do next? The answer: cognitive behavioral therapy. That brings me to the point where I entered treatment with Mary Solanto, Ph.D. About a dozen or so sessions with her filled in the missing links\u2014the tricks and tactics to which I referred earlier. \u201cTricks,\u201d by the way, is not a term that is demeaning, dismissive, or pejorative. The fact is that these little \u201ctricks\u201d have proved to be life-savers for me. And since I believe they can be life-savers for many fellow sufferers with ADHD, I have decided to write this book. I\u2019ve decided to divide this book not into chapters but into \u201cproblems,\u201d with each short\u2014really short\u2014section devoted to one of the commonest problems experienced or commonest complaints expressed by ADHD people (or at least by me). For each problem, I propose a few \u201cSimple Rules\u201d to help solve it. I hope it helps. PROBLEM I: \u201cI KEEP FORGETTING THINGS\u201d Let\u2019s start with a simple problem\u2014forgetting things. Whenever I left the house to go to work, it seemed I had forgotten something I needed: pens, wallet, pager, appointment book, a manuscript I was reviewing, whatever. Simple Rule #1: Post a checklist on the door. Nothing special. You don\u2019t have to read and abide by every detail of Atul Gawande\u2019s brilliant little monograph, \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto.\u201d Just make a list of the essential items for every day\u2019s work and stick it up on your exit door. Here is what mine looks like: \uf0b7 Pens \uf0b7 Wallet \uf0b7 Calendar books \uf0b7 Blackberry \uf0b7 Pager \uf0b7 Special The only reason that \u201cKeys\u201d isn\u2019t on my list is that I can\u2019t start the car without them anyhow, and house and office keys are also on the same key ring. And what does \u201cSpecial\u201d mean? It refers to anything I particularly need for that particular day. It means I pause for a moment and think about that day\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d activities\u2014a journal review, a meeting agenda, notes for a research conference, etc. I should point out that reviewing the list isn\u2019t sufficient. As you read each item, pat yourself wherever needed to be sure that the item is actually there. Nobody has to watch you go through this odd self-touching ritual; just do it. Simple Rule #2: Set up a tray. For physical and occupational therapists, \u201cADL\u201d means \u201cActivities of Daily Living.\u201d For those of us with ADHD, it could stand for \u201cAccessories"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_4", "text": "for Daily Living,\u201d many of which are tabulated on the sample checklist in Simple Rule #1 above. The checklist, however, only reminds you what they are; it doesn\u2019t tell you where to find them. So set up a tray somewhere near the entrance to your home. When you get in, dump the accessories into the tray: car keys, sunglasses, wallet, whatever. If you need to keep some of the items with you wherever you go at home\u2014perhaps your pager or cellphone\u2014then have a second tray in the bedroom for those articles. Now nothing gets forgotten or lost; everything is in the trays. Simple Rule #3: Don\u2019t go yet; stop. As you leave a room, don\u2019t leave. Stop for a minute; look around. Is there a book on the desk that you\u2019re supposed to take with you? Is your briefcase sitting there, left behind? The pause just gave you a second chance. Or if you\u2019re in the kitchen, are your breakfast dishes still on the table? Pick them up, rinse them off, put them away, and make somebody happy. Dirty clothes in the bedroom? Same thing; into the laundry hamper. Now you\u2019re not a slob; you\u2019re a hero. Simple Rule #4: Never assume that you\u2019re going to remember something without help. If you are interrupted while you\u2019re on-line or on the phone, and there is something you were supposed to do when you were finished, the chances are that you\u2019re going to forget the task by the time you return to the computer or the telephone. So just as you are turning away to deal with the interruption, write yourself a 2-3 word reminder that you are sure to see when the interruption is over. A notepad next to the computer or the phone is a handy device for this purpose. You might even jot the reminder on a Post- It\u00ae note to stick on the computer screen or the telephone. Don\u2019t let these notes accumulate, though; they could pile up, make a mess, and thus become part of the problem instead of the solution. As soon as your memory has been jogged and the purpose fulfilled, discard the note and leave the pad free for the next time. PROBLEM II: \u201cI CAN\u2019T GET ORGANIZED\u201d Organizational ability is not a rare gift of nature, and it does not take a miracle to acquire it. Organizational ability is just a fancy name for doing whatever it is that needs doing. No matter how bad our case of ADHD may be, we know perfectly well what needs doing; we just have trouble doing it. Simple Rule #1: Make a list. It doesn\u2019t have to be a checklist. It doesn\u2019t have to be in any particular order\u2014not priority order, not chronological order, not alphabetical order. Just make a list of whatever needs doing. Once it\u2019s down on paper (or a hard drive or whatever), it\u2019s off your shoulders. You don\u2019t have to carry it around in your conscious, subconscious, or preconscious mind. You don\u2019t"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_5", "text": "have to worry about it ever again. All you have to do is look at the list, pick something off it, and sooner or later just do it. Now let\u2019s talk about \u201csooner or later.\u201d Simple Rule #2: Transfer each item to a schedule. The shape, size, and format of the schedule don\u2019t matter. Paper, electronic, digital, portable, desktop; it doesn\u2019t make any difference. It just has to be a schedule. My own favorites for schedules are 3x6\u201d calendar books: the TIMEWISE\u00ae Pocket Memo System for daily two-page entries in a monthly calendar book and the TIMEWISE\u00ae Two-Year Calendar for future commitments. If I don\u2019t do something on the day it\u2019s scheduled, no sweat; I just transfer it to another day. The point is, nothing ever gets forgotten and everything ultimately gets done. Simple Rule #3: Never mind the schedule if the item doesn\u2019t fit. Some tasks, projects, or ambitions are too vague to be amenable to scheduling. Not to worry. Write them down anyhow. In simplest format, I write these overarching aims in a list on one of the unmarked pages at the front of my monthly calendar books. Miraculously, by the end of the month, not too many of them remain incomplete; but for those that do, they just get transferred to the front page of the next month\u2019s book. Ultimately, they get done, or else become no longer relevant. When I was nearly overwhelmed with responsibilities for a few years as Vice Chairman of my Department of Medicine, I resorted to a slightly more elaborate system called Exec-U-Scan\u00ae, which allowed me to put each job or each piece of responsibility on a 2x4\u201d card and insert it into a slot in a slim 8 \u00bd x 11\u201d fake leather folder that held 72 such cards in four neat columns. Another card holder I\u2019ve used in other circumstances is called the Axcess T-Card system (www.npsg.com); it works just about the same way, with the added attraction that the cards come in five different colors. Still another system is called Memogenda (Norwood Products Co., Inc.) These devices didn\u2019t actually do any of the work for me but they sure made me feel as though I were in control of my responsibilities, and even better, conveyed that impression to my colleagues and my boss. The particular system you use doesn\u2019t really matter. All that matters is that everything gets captured in writing one way or another. Remember: Whatever is written down automatically becomes finite and manageable. Simple Rule #4: Capture every task in writing before you forget it. I remember a lot of my to-do jobs when I\u2019m in bed or in the car and find it inconvenient if not impossible to write it down immediately. Of course, if I don\u2019t write it down immediately, I\u2019ll forget it. (ADHD, remember?) So I have a tiny dictating machine at the bedside and also strapped to the visor of the car, so that when the job pops into my head, I record"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_6", "text": "it on the machine before it pops out again. From the machine, it\u2019s easy to get it somewhere onto one of the lists (if I don\u2019t forget to make the transfer). PROBLEM III: \u201cI CAN\u2019T SEEM TO GET STARTED\u201d No matter how big or how little the job is, the hardest part seems to be sitting ourselves down and getting started. There is something weirdly intimidating about making the commitment to begin. But once we start, the worst is often over (unless we get distracted\u2014more about that in the next section). Simple Rule #1: Chip off a little chunk of the job for starters. This rule is analogous to the Chinese proverb, \u201cA journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step,\u201d or more prosaically, we usually put pants on just one leg at a time. Before starting any project, even something as simple as paying a stack of bills or answering some mail, I used to have to be sure that I had a completely clear playing field ahead\u2014a guaranteed stretch of several hours in which I could not be distracted or interrupted. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of possible taskus interruptus. These guaranteed stretches were generally between 2 and 5 AM. Jobs ultimately got done but only at the price of serious sleep deprivation. The remedy proved strikingly simple. Don\u2019t think of the task as a monolithic whole; regard it as a series of little chunks. No matter how intimidating the whole task appears, don\u2019t be afraid to start off with just one tiny chunk. It will mean that you\u2019ve accomplished something and, more often than not, this breaking of the ice will reveal that it\u2019s not such a big glacier after all. In fact, taking the first whack at will probably initiate a continuing stream of ice chips until you\u2019ve knocked off more of the job than you had anticipated at the outset. Simple Rule #2: Come back anytime and chip off a little bit more. The same principle that applies to starting the job applies to making continuing progress on it. Once you realize that it\u2019s not like trying to jump over a canyon in two leaps, you can finish almost any job in stages, one piece at a time. In fact, this \u201cone piece at a time\u201d trick is very useful for filling \u201ctime chinks\u201d\u2014little segments of perhaps 15 to 30 minutes available and all-too-easy to fritter away. But if you have a job that can be chipped away at in pieces, an unscheduled \u201ctime chink\u201d is ideal for filling with one of those detached pieces. Mastering this chink-filling technique is part of the overall therapeutic goal of freeing ourselves from the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d thinking that is so inimical to us ADHD people. PROBLEM IV: \u201cI GET DISTRACTED\u201d There is a reason they call this thing \u201cattention deficit.\u201d It means we too easily get distracted. Solving this problem requires a fair amount of conscious effort. Simple Rule #1: Remember who\u2019s in charge here. Unless you have"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_7", "text": "just been recalled to active military duty, you are in complete charge of what you choose to do or not do at any given moment. So you\u2019re the boss; you set the program and you decide whether or not to stick with it. Simple Rule #2: Stick with the program. Nobody is holding a gun to your head to make you abandon your self-prescribed program and go off to do something else. If the temptation arises\u2014and of course it will\u2014exert your exclusive authority and say to yourself (out loud if necessary, assuming no one is listening), \u201cI\u2019m in charge here and I order me to stick with my program.\u201d Simple Rule #3: Cognition rules. When you are tempted to wander off course, recognize that it is the siren song of ADHD coaxing you away. It is impulse that is trying to lure you off track, not reason. Sure, you can always make up a reason that you really need to make a phone call, read the newspaper, check your e-mail, or look in the refrigerator instead of finishing your report due tomorrow. But the rationalization is usually spurious. Tell yourself, \u201cImpulse be damned; cognition rules!\u201d PROBLEM V: \u201cI LOSE TRACK OF TIME\u201d A distorted perception of time is one of the hallmarks of ADHD. Almost all of us have it, and it means (a) things always take longer than we think they will and (b) we are very often late for appointments. Actually, the two problems are closely linked. Simple Rule #1: Plan double the time to do a job that you first estimate. Really, it\u2019s no joke; don\u2019t kid yourself. Thirty minutes to shower and get dressed? Figure sixty. Two hours to pay the week\u2019s bills? Allow four. Three days to read all the files on a case? Plan six. One week to prepare the tax returns? Fugeddaboudit; it\u2019ll take two. This rule has a broader corollary, to follow. Simple Rule #2: Lower your expectations. It\u2019s not just that those of us with ADHD can\u2019t work as fast as we think we can. We can\u2019t do most things as smoothly, easily, effortlessly, or efficiently as we wish we could or think we should. This impairment means that we should never be reluctant to use external aids, just as someone with a gait disorder might need crutches. We all need crutches. In fact, one of the goals of this book is to help us find crutches that work. In previous sections, we\u2019ve talked about checklists, schedulers, dictating machines, and even phrases to recite to ourselves. Now we\u2019re about to suggest one of the simplest crutches of all. Simple Rule #3: Set an alarm clock. I guarantee you: for those of us with ADHD, an alarm clock is a virtually indispensable survival tool. You think you can\u2019t possibly forget that you\u2019re supposed to leave for your haircut in ten minutes? Believe me, you\u2019ll forget. The important call you promised to make to your client at 2 PM? You\u2019ll forget. Set the"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_8", "text": "darn alarm clock! Simple Rule #4: The time you have to do something is not the same as the time you have to get ready to do it. This rule is perhaps the most self-evident of all of them, but it was somehow one of the hardest for me to assimilate and act upon. We have to leave for the restaurant in town at 5:15 PM? Yeah, I know; so what? It\u2019s only 5:13 PM. Hey, Dummy; it takes more than two minutes to shut down the computer, put on the coat, find the car keys, and settle the dog. So here\u2019s what needs to be done: (a) establish the time for departure, or whatever it is we have to do; (b) estimate the time it will take to get ready; (c) double the estimate (see Simple Rule #1). Then set the darn alarm clock. PROBLEM VI: \u201cI NEVER GET AROUND TO THE BIG JOBS\u201d We all have big jobs we want to complete, but the little jobs always seem to get in the way. There is a big report to write, a long novel to read, a challenging piano piece to learn\u2014but, oh no, first we have a phone call to make, an e-mail to send, a package to open. Then by the time we\u2019ve gotten these little jobs out of the way\u2014whoops! No time to get to the big job today. Sigh\u2026.Perhaps some other time\u2026. Simple Rule #1: Learn to leapfrog. Leapfrogging is one of our most powerful tools. It simply means taking a non-deadline, non-time dependent job of low urgency but high priority that we\u2019d like to accomplish, and consciously, deliberately leapfrogging it over all the little stuff that invariably gets in the way. Here\u2019s how it works for me. I take piano lessons. I don\u2019t mind practicing; sometimes I even like it because once in a while the music actually sounds nice. But my lessons take place only once every week or two, and there are always lots of tasks I need to finish on a daily basis. In fact, there they are on my list for the day (see Simple Rule #1 for Problem I). How am I ever going to get around to practicing the piano? Simple! Just leapfrog the practice session over everything else on the list and do it first! But wait; isn\u2019t that a violation of Simple Rule #2 for Problem IV (\u201cStick to the program\u201d)? Well, yes and no, but mostly no. What we\u2019re doing here is deliberately modifying the program\u2014not abandoning it\u2014to allow room for a goal of high priority (life-fulfilling priority, that is) ahead of minor daily tasks that are going to get done anyhow. That\u2019s the key point: the little tasks are going to get done sooner or later as long as they\u2019re still on the list, but the big important goal is never going to get attended to if it isn\u2019t leapfrogged, at least sometimes. Simple Rule #2: There is no Simple Rule #2. Simple Rule"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_9", "text": "#1 is the only one that will work for this particular problem. PROBLEM VII: \u201cI\u2019M DROWNING IN PAPERWORK\u201d You don\u2019t have to be an ADHD person to suffer from the syndrome of a desk buried under intimidating piles of paper, but it\u2019s sure a lot worse for us. Simple Rule #1: Your desktop is a tarmac, not a hangar. The top of your desk is not designed or intended for long- term storage. File drawers are meant for that purpose, although wastepaper baskets and shredders are often preferable. The point is that your desktop is only a tarmac\u2014meant for papers and things to touch down briefly and then take off again for final destinations. Simple Rule #2: Touch each item only once if it can be filed away. The ideal itinerary for each incoming item is a non-stop flight. If it\u2019s destined for a file, as with insurance papers, bank statements, appliance guarantees, or responses to your Christmas cards, then put it straight into its final resting place as soon as it arrives, with no stopovers on your desktop. Simple Rule #3. If you don\u2019t have a drawer with files for each category of document, make one. But if it an item requires action before it can be filed, then we move on to Simple Rule #4. Simple Rule #4: Set up three separate trays for items of different time- priority.( I say \u201ctime-priority\u201d so as not to confuse it with \u201clife-priority.\u201d See Problem VI.) If you cannot touch an item only once en route to its final destination, then put it into a tray depending upon when you have to act upon it: Tray #1: It has to be dealt with today. Tray #2: It has to be dealt with before a certain date but not today. Tray #3: It has to be dealt with sooner or later but not by any particular date. There; now everything is in three neat trays and your desk looks really neat. Isn\u2019t that better? Simple Rule #5: Touch each Tray 1 item only once more today. At the end of the day, Tray #1 should be empty. If it isn\u2019t, don\u2019t torture yourself; let the unfinished item(s) stay there one more day and get them done for sure tomorrow. Simple Rule #6: Subdivide Tray #2 according to deadline date. Notebook dividers with tabs are handy for separating items according to date; so are manila folders and accordion files. Of course, not every item comes with a specified deadline date for completion. That\u2019s where Simple Rule #1 for Problem IV is invaluable: You\u2019re in charge, so you set the date. Simple Rule #7: The items in Tray #3 are ripe for leapfrogging. (see Simple Rule #1 for Problem VI.) Take a look every so often at Tray #3 and leapfrog anything you want over everything else. That\u2019s the beauty of being in charge. PROBLEM VIII: \u201cI GET OVERWHELMED SO EASILY\u201d Everybody gets overwhelmed sometimes, but those of us with ADHD too often live"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_10", "text": "in a constant state of feeling that way. The 19 simple rules we\u2019ve outlined so far should help with this problem.* *Compulsion alert: Try to resist the temptation to go back and count them up. But there are some additional rules as well as some reminders that may be important in gaining control over ourselves and our feelings. Simple Rule #1: Give every disturbing feeling a name. Think of the Bible. How did God give Adam dominion over every living thing? By giving him the power to name everything. It\u2019s true: Naming something gives us power over it. Whether or not you choose to put the names of those feelings onto a written list is up to you. (See Simple Rule #1 for Problem II.) But if you\u2019ve got them named, they\u2019re more amenable to being pinned down under your control. Simple Rule #2: Ask yourself what\u2019s the worst thing that could possibly happen. Go ahead; indulge your fear and imagine the worst-case scenario. What will happen if you miss a deadline? Are you fired, homeless, and in the gutter? No, more likely you\u2019ll have to ask for an extension or make up the time on the next task. What will happen if you forget an appointment? Prison, torture, or execution? No, more likely you\u2019ll face embarrassment, have a lot of explaining to do, and reschedule the meeting. What will happen if you leave your wallet behind? Washing dishes in the restaurant all night? No, more likely someone else will have to pay the bill; oh, well. Simple Rule #3: If you get angry with yourself, don\u2019t take it out on anyone else. If you screw up\u2014and you surely will, because we all do\u2014 it\u2019s natural to berate yourself. But don\u2019t take it out on your family or friends or co-workers, or blame your significant other, or kick the dog. It\u2019s not their fault. In fact, it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault. You may be the one who screwed up, but you didn\u2019t do it on purpose; you didn\u2019t do it because you\u2019re mean or stupid or ugly or lazy; you did it because you\u2019re human, even with our without ADHD. So take a look at what happened; name the problem that caused it (see Simple Rule #1 above); and move on. PROBLEM IX: \u201cNONE OF THESE RULES IS WORKING\u201d Actually, this problem is unlikely to occur in the grammatical form stated above. At least some of these rules are bound to work. The more likely form of the problem is, \u201cNot all of these rules are working.\u201d Hardly a surprise. In the immortal closing words of the classic Billy Wilder film, Some Like It Hot, \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d Simple Rule #1: Lower your expectations. Let\u2019s pick it up with that Joe E. Brown Principle from Some Like It Hot: \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d This precept is true for all of living humanity, and those of us with ADHD have special problems, but too many of us expect to be perfect. So remember: Even with"}

Those of us with ADHD have a disorder (the second \u201cD,\u201d right?). The former Chairman of my Department, in another context, once gave me what is perhaps the best advice I ever received: \u201cDavid, cut yourself some slack.\u201d I love that admonition. In fact, I love it so much, I think I\u2019ll reword this rule. Simple Rule #1 (restated): Cut yourself some slack. Simple Rule #2: Take a few breaths. I tend to go nuts over every little thing. Something drops or something spills (let me reword that: I drop something or spill something), and I\u2019m fuming and cursing\u2014usually at the top of my lungs; just ask my wife. That doesn\u2019t happen so much any more, though; partly thanks to Strattera (see the Introduction) but also in large measure because I\u2019ve learned to stop, take a few breaths, and say to myself (even out loud, but quietly), \u201cOops. It dropped. I\u2019d better pick it up,\u201d or, \u201cOops (a really useful word for us folks with ADHD, except in an operating room). It spilled. I\u2019d better wipe it up.\u201d It\u2019s really easy and it helps a lot. PROBLEM X: \u201cSO I FINISHED THE BOOK, NOW WHAT\u201d OK, we\u2019ve just gone through a bunch of problems and a lot of rules. So where do we begin with implementation? Simple Rule #1: Never mind the problems you\u2019ve got that we didn\u2019t cover; just pick the ones that we did. I\u2019ll give you 10-to-1 odds that you don\u2019t have all the problems discussed in this book, and also that you have some that weren\u2019t even mentioned. But I\u2019ll give you 50-to-one odds that you\u2019ve got at least one of the problems we covered. So forget all the rest and just go back and reread the sections that ring a bell with you. Simple Rule #2: Start with the easiest rule. Don\u2019t worry about the biggest problems, whether they\u2019re creating the most trouble in life or seem like the hardest ones to solve. Pick the one Simple Rule that is the simplest one of all for you\u2014preferably childishly, foolishly, laughably simple\u2014and try that one first. It\u2019s the best place to start. Simple Rule #3: Don\u2019t think you have to follow the rules in any logical order. Just because the easiest rule was listed with a particular number problem, the next rule you adopt doesn\u2019t have to come under the same number. The rules should be followed in order of simplicity and ease of carrying out, not in order of importance or, Heaven forbid, in any strict numerical sequence. Simple Rule #4: Don\u2019t kick the dog or yourself. In case you\u2019ve been reading this book in order\u2014which I\u2019ve just assured you that you needn\u2019t have done\u2014you\u2019ll recognize this rule as stemming from the discussion of Problem IX. Still, it applies widely to just about all our problems and it can\u2019t be overemphasized. You\u2019ve come this far, you\u2019ve lived"}
{"id": "adhd_1498592607_12", "text": "this long, and you\u2019ve shown the incredible wisdom and good judgment to read this book; so how bad can things really be? The fact is, that while all the problems we\u2019ve covered are real and sometimes serious, the rules are simple and not obligatory (except for not kicking the dog). So if there is something you really, really want or need to do, and if you can\u2019t find a rule in this book that helps you do it, then forget the book and forget the rules and follow the advice I sometimes give myself: \u201cAw, the heck with everything; just go ahead and *@#&!*!! do it!\u201d About IPI eBooks IPI eBooks is a project of the International Psychotherapy Institute.
