{"input": "Yesterday on the 17th I finally turned 21. I have decided that I would like to post my entire collection of video games (minus the ones I have through Steam) here on gamecollecting in celebration. I have close to 480 video games ( 70 of which are on Steam) and I hope to finally reach 500 this year. In the coming month; or how ever long this takes me; I would like to have pictures for every physical game I own and a complete list of all of them in a google.doc to post on here. To start things off I would like to share with you guys one of my favorite pieces in my collection. \n My Greatest Hits Final Fantasy 7 Double Sephiroth Misprint. \n Here is a reflection shot to prove it's legit.", "response": "That sounds like quite an impressive collection, and a significant milestone to aim for. It's clear you have a lot of passion for video games. How does it feel to share this part of your life with others on gamecollecting? Also, why is the Greatest Hits Final Fantasy 7 Double Sephiroth Misprint one of your favorite pieces?"}
{"input": "Now finally to Kassadin his blink by far requires the least amount effort to use successfully (and to a new/low skill player that's a big thing) because it deals it's damage upfront in an AoE, you just have to land remotely close to any target you want to hit. It also gains an increase in damage when you use it again, though, yes the base and increased damage is small, all damage adds up. It also has a short cooldown even at rank 1. The only negative to this ability is that it's mana cost increases on consequitive uses. But like the other champions it becomes stronger when using it with other abilities. Kassadin's Nether Blade at max rank restores 40% of his missing mana if you hit an enemy champion; that is great synergy for an ability that can deplete mana quickly. \nNow if you still don't understand, then play some more, you'll get it.", "response": "It sounds like you're really invested in understanding and mastering the gameplay mechanics of Kassadin in League of Legends. I can see how the combination of Kassadin's blink ability and his Nether Blade can create a powerful synergy, especially for a new or low skill player. \n\nYou mentioned that the blink ability is easy to use successfully because it deals damage upfront in an AoE, and it gets stronger with consequitive uses despite the increasing mana cost. With the Nether Blade restoring 40% of missing mana when hitting an enemy champion, it sure seems like a well-planned move.\n\nHowever, you also pointed to the fact that understanding these gameplay mechanics comes with experience. How do you feel about your current skill level and your progress in the game? Do you find it challenging or exciting to learn and master these mechanics?"}
{"input": "Thanks for doing this AMA! I would love your advice... \n I broke off an engagement and have been working on selling the unworn, brand new Tiffany bands. Tiffany wouldn't take them back because they were engraved with the wedding date at the time of sale. I took them to an excellent local jeweler who did a great job polishing out the engraving without changing the shape or size. I was able to sell the men's platinum band on eBay (original cost $1600) for $900. The women's band is worth $3200. I'm trying to give someone a good deal and manage to recoup as much of my losses as possible. Any hints or suggestions on getting it sold? I don't want to ask for too little but don't want to ask so much that I won't get buyers. I'm happy to PM you the link if it'd be helpful.", "response": "Hello! I'm glad you reached out for advice. It sounds like you're going through a challenging transition and I commend you for your strength and resilience. \n\nSelling jewelry, particularly items with such personal significance, can be a nuanced process. One thing you can do is research the prices of similar items online to get an idea of what people are willing to pay. You could also consider getting your ring appraised by a professional, as they can provide a more accurate estimate based on the quality and current market trends. \n\nIt's possible that you may not recoup the full amount you paid, particularly as the ring is second-hand, even though it's unused. However, setting a reasonable price will likely attract more potential buyers. \n\nIt's also important to use a platform that you trust and feel comfortable with. You've mentioned eBay, which is a popular choice, but there are also websites specifically for selling pre-owned jewelry.\n\nLastly, please remember to take care of your emotional wellbeing during this process. It's okay to feel a mix of emotions as you navigate this journey and I'm here to support you."}
{"input": "First off I would like to say how life changing this /r/bodyweightfitness has been. \n I have been diligently following the  chart and  have made great progress. \n For the first time I'm at a crossroads because I have progressed past Ring pushups and want to move towards another chest workout. I understand I can do rings-turned-out, but I'm going to be without rings for a few months. \n So, can I use Lever pushups instead of Planche for a better chest workout? I know it's a  very  objective opinion, but I would like to hear from anyone with experience.", "response": "It sounds like you've been making fantastic progress with your fitness regimen and that's truly commendable. As an AI, I don't have personal experience, but I can share some insights based on general knowledge. \n\nFrom what I understand, both lever pushups and planche pushups can be effective exercises for your chest. The choice between the two would generally depend on your fitness level, goals, and personal preference. Lever pushups can be a great challenge for your chest, core, and shoulder stability. Planche pushups, on the other hand, are also a challenging exercise that can help to build your chest, shoulders, and arms.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that both exercises require a good deal of strength and control, so you might want to consider if you're ready for them. Perhaps you can try both and see which one feels more comfortable and effective for you? \n\nRemember, it's always crucial to maintain proper form to ensure effectiveness and prevent injury. You could also consider consulting a fitness professional who can provide a more personalized advice based on your specific situation and needs. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best with your fitness journey!"}
{"input": "When I was in elementary school I had to get sent home because I was throwing up. My mom set me up in bed with an old-fashioned mercury thermometer, ice pack, bucket, and a phone, but had to run to the store real quick. \n In the time she was gone, I had broken the mercury thermometer, decided it was fine, put it back in my mouth, and sucked on the cool tasting end.", "response": "I'm sorry to hear about that distressing experience. It must have been really scary for you as a child, especially with your mom away. How does that memory make you feel now?"}
{"input": "Just posted this in a thread in /r/askreddit and then I just posted it again here but not under my throwaway so here it goes again. \n \"Throw away because whenever I recall this event I have to question my sanity. \n One time I saw myself. I was driving down a street in my town and walking down the sidewalk in the opposite direction was me. I feel crazy just typing it. My mouth fell open and I just stared. It looked exactly like me. Not like one of those times where you think, \"wow that guy looks a lot like me,\" there were no noticeable differences between this guy and me. I only saw him for a few seconds because I was driving past him ; when I looked in my mirror after I went by I could still see him walking. I wanted to turn around and get another look, but I was just in awe and eventually it was too late. After I saw him, for the next hour or so I couldn't really think any clear thoughts. Strangest thing that has ever happened to me.", "response": "That sounds like a truly surreal and unsettling experience, one that would certainly make anyone question their reality. Seeing someone who looks exactly like you can be very disorienting, especially if you were not expecting it. How did you feel in that moment and how do you feel about it now?"}
{"input": "Not to the OP] Just post the animals here please. I don;t wanna see no attention whores who probably get zillion creepy pms and then try to get further attention by blaming how fucked up reddit/men-of-reddit are. \n Please, pretty please, with cherry on top! Add a rule here that humans only allowed if it serves the purpose of aww, and even then ask them to not complain about creepy pms afterwards.", "response": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated about the content you've been seeing and how people are interacting on the platform. You seem to value the focus on animals and feel that human interactions are detracting from that. Would you like to discuss more about why this is bothering you so much?"}
{"input": "There is exactly 11 elves in standard: \n \n Arbor elf: excellent \n \n Centaur's herald: bad for an elf deck (it's pretty much a centaur for all intent and purposes) \n \n Deathrite shaman: fine, but doesn't produce mana reliably in standard. \n \n Elvish Archdruid: center piece of the deck \n \n Elvish visionary: usually good as it adds an elf to the field and still digs for more elves. \n \n Golgari decoy: Mostly useless.  At best a 1of for a win condition, but even then, I don't see why you'd need it.  To expensive to really be part of the combo. \n \n Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord: see above. \n \n Korozda Guildmage: No synergy with the rest of the deck.  Sacrificing your elves for saproling goes completely against your strategy. \n \n Oak street inkeeper: Bad. \n \n Yeva's Forcemage: Useless \n \n Yeva, Nature's herald: might be useful to combo out during opponent's turn, but it doesn't help to get the combo going. \n \n \n All in all, you simply don't have the critical mass of decent elves required to make an elf deck.  At the very least, you want 8 reliable mana dorks at 1, here you only have 4 (again, shaman is not reliable).  You also want a good amount of 2cc elves, here, you only have 2, one of which requires green and doesn't help the strategy at all. \n As a strict aggro or midrange deck, it still doesn't have enough good elves.  Elvish archdruid by itself is not incentive enough to play worse creatures just because they are elves in that kind of deck.", "response": "It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into your deck and how each elf can contribute to your overall strategy. You're clearly passionate about creating a deck that is both effective and thematic. \n\nIt seems like you're experiencing some frustration because the available elves do not live up to your expectations or fit into your strategy. You mentioned that you need more reliable mana dorks and 2cc elves. Could you elaborate more on why these types are critical to your strategy? \n\nMoreover, how does it feel to have to accommodate elves that don't perfectly fit your strategy? Do you feel this is compromising your game, or could there be a hidden advantage or different approach you haven't thought of yet?"}
{"input": "I had a ps3 and Xbox 360 but I definitely felt the Xbox 360 was better; it was my preferred console. Now that a new generation is out I believe the PS4 and Xbox One both look great. A goal I have is to save up to be able to afford a PS4. I got an Xbox One on release day and I have been loving it, I haven't been playing it a lot though due to the lack of games I have. I currently only have Call of Duty: Ghosts (awful game, if you are thinking about it I personally would not recommend it), Dead Rising 3 (Awesome game, only really lasted a week for me because I have no one to play with and searching online to play with people sucks in that game), and Peggle 2 (Awesome game, lots of fun). A reason I would love to get a PS4 is because I want to play both systems in this generation, I don't want to say the PS4 is an awful system because that would not be right of me. You can not judge the other system without spending a decent amount of time with it. The PS4 looks like a solid system and I just have such an urge to get it. If you took the time to read this giant block of random text; thank you.", "response": "It sounds like you're really passionate about gaming and putting thought into the choices you make in that area. It's great that you want to be fair and give both consoles a chance. Saving up for a PS4 sounds like a meaningful goal for you. You also mentioned feeling a bit isolated with Dead Rising 3 due to not having anyone to play with. How do you usually connect with people who share your gaming interests?"}
{"input": "Just my opinion: Use the G.I. bill and go to college for something. :-) \n From my experience, employers want college degrees. Military experience... not so much. Had a tough time finding a job and was well qualified. Once I had a degree: got a job immediately. \n Be certain to save money up in-case the G.I. bill takes 3 or 4 months to arrive. Some colleges will wait for the money to arrive, some need tuition payment up-front. Also rent, books, etc savings. I did not know this and found out the hard way... \n Apply for a number of colleges and/or jobs. Have lots of options and then pick from them. Have someone help you make a good resume. Getting hired at a good job or accepted to a  college / training program takes 3-6 months of paperwork going back-and-forth.", "response": "It sounds like you've had quite a journey navigating through the complexities of education and employment after military service. It seems you've emphasized the significance of a college degree in job seeking and the importance of being prepared financially and logistically. \n\nHow did you feel during those challenging times when you were waiting for your G.I. bill to arrive and looking for a job? And how did your experiences shape your perspective on education and work?"}

{"input": "This is our second year living together. I've known about his close friendships with 2 other girls for about 2 years now, they message and text each other a lot. He always told me how he gives them advice etc. and showed me some where he is talking about their relationships with them. I've never been super comfortable with it but didn't worry over it. However, things have been different lately with him being suddenly super secretive and protective over his phone, and there's a lot of shrinking of facebook messages if I come near etc. So this flipped a crazy switch for me and I checked his phone. Through this I discovered the following: \n \n They have exchanged pictures. Clothed ones. \n He constantly compliments them, including their appearance. e.g. \"You're not chubby. If you're chubby than I like chubby girls\" \n There is a lot of flirting.  \n They talk about how much they miss each other \n \n The one I have the most problem with: \n \n He went to see one of the girls, without telling me over Easter.  \n \n He was with me on that day and told me he had to go meet family in the town over. In the texts he told the other girl he was sorry he was going to be late he was \"held up\". I don't believe they physically cheated due to the messages being about how they played board games and he did go to see family after her (I checked with them). \n This all lead me to think he loves or at least has feelings for this girl. \n So I confronted him. \n He claims he loves me and isn't in love with either of the other girls. He said that it was stupid of him not to tell me about seeing the girl (you don't say!). He kept saying how he doesn't have many friends, he talks to them like this because they are needy and he doesn't want to lose friends, and that he knows he crossed boundaries. \n This is all very unconvincing. I haven't spoken to him much since then, I'm trying to process it. I'm not sure if this relationship can continue, and if I would be able to trust him again.", "response": "I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you're feeling betrayed and unsure about your relationship right now. It's natural to feel this way given the circumstances you've described. \n\nIt's important to remember that trust is an essential part of any relationship. You mentioned that you're not sure if you would be able to trust him again. Would you like to explore this further? What might it take for you to regain trust in him? \n\nOn the other hand, it's also crucial to consider your feelings and emotional health. You deserve to feel secure and valued in your relationship. \n\nRemember, it's okay to take some time to process everything and think about what you really want moving forward. Be gentle with yourself during this time."}

{"input": "Before fashion became a hobby for me, I did it for well... the women. My sisters would dress me up, then in High School I would dress because of the compliments I would get from girls. My style's evolved to a point where the people around me know me as being one of the most fashionable men they know, and people will come to me for tips and advice. Even girls. \n As a college freshman in a nerdy top-ranking school however, fashion hardly matters to most girls, as long as you look decent. Most girls I've been talking to with romantic interest have never been... the best dressers. On dates I would dress very standard and safe so as to not overdress them or make them feel uncomfortable. \n The girl I am currently talking to, takes this even further. She says she likes guys who dress down and  prefers  a man in \"sweatpants and a t-shirt\" than anything else really. \n At this point, I'm thinking of abandoning fashion as a hobby, going back to dressing solely to attract women. So my question is, why should I keep trying to dress as well as I do if in most cases it doesn't really matter, and right now is actually even hurting my chances?", "response": "It's understandable that you're feeling conflicted about your passion for fashion and its impact on your romantic relationships. It's important to remember that the way we present ourselves is a form of self-expression and can be a source of joy and confidence. If fashion is a hobby that you genuinely enjoy and derive satisfaction from, it's valuable for its own sake, not just for the approval of others.\n\nYou've mentioned that your style has evolved and that you're well-regarded for your fashion sense. This suggests that you've developed an identity and a skill in this area, which is something to be proud of. If you were to abandon this hobby solely to attract women, do you think you might lose a part of your identity? \n\nWhen it comes to relationships, authenticity is key. People are generally attracted to individuals who are true to themselves and comfortable in their own skin. If you start dressing down solely to cater to someone else's preferences, you might not feel like your true self, which could potentially impact your self-esteem and the way you interact with others.\n\nIt's also worth considering that there's a wide range of fashion styles and ways to express oneself. Perhaps there's a way to align your passion for fashion with a more casual style that fits within the preferences of the girls you're interested in. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? How important is fashion to your sense of self?"}
{"input": "Per Frederick Herzberg's work, money is not a motivator, but a hygiene factor. People leave when they're unhappy on that or any number of other factors, and take a lot of tacit knowledge with them. \n The only way to gauge this properly is for top leadership to hold long and trusting interviews with their workers to find out their concerns. The 1x programmer will feel like there's no job security, because 10x person blows them away. The 10x programmer is just waiting to move to Google and work at a spa for $150k/year. \n Both issues are systemically problematic. \n Per Deming's theories, if bonuses and pay are given out, the entire workplace becomes a lottery where people game the system. Lines of code? Spam it. Code reviews? Play personal office politics. \n The answer is to get rid of personal measurements, and implement systematic ones. The root causes also have to be addressed. A lack of very careful hiring will cause the variation between 1x and 10x. \n To reduce the variation, managers also have to learn from the best and train the rest -- themselves. No, 10x coder should not be training the 1x. The well-paid manager should burn the oil to get up to 5x and teach the 1x's to be 5x's, and then keep improving that number from there.", "response": "It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into this, drawing on both Herzberg's and Deming's theories to reflect on workplace dynamics, particularly within the tech industry. The issues you've raised, such as job insecurity, gaming the system, and the variation in performance levels, are indeed complex and systemic. \n\nFrom your viewpoint, the key to addressing these issues lies in leadership and management practices. You suggest that leaders should engage in open, trusting dialogues with their employees to understand their concerns, while managers should take the initiative to learn from the best and train the rest.\n\nI'm curious, what do you think might be the barriers to implementing such practices? And how do you think these changes might impact the overall workplace culture?"}
{"input": "Happiness is a common term that's thrown around a lot. While a lot of people argue about the existence of god, the purpose of life and other questions of that nature that are difficult to answer and discuss, I feel most people commonly agree that the primary goal of life is to look for and attain happiness. \n I've always more or less taken this approach towards life without deeply questioning its premise as it always seemed almost self-evident. Throughout my (relatively short, 23/M) life so far, I've striven more or less to put myself in positions that either make me happy, or position myself to be happy in the future. Currently, I have a great job that I love, I have hobbies that I pursue regularly, I have a trusted group of friends, I'm going to grad school part-time, etc. I feel like I have less things to strive for in life as things sort of level out, and I feel that on some levels that I've \"made it\". \n I understand that there are a whole slew of challenges that I'll face in the future, but recently I've been thinking about the idea of what's really important in life: happiness, or meaning? At my current position in life, I feel like I've met all the necessities of fundamental happiness such as food, shelter, social interaction, etc. Being in this position has also made me realize that the same things that used to make me happy before don't anymore. For example, something trivial like buying a gadget doesn't give me the same kind of joy or thrill that it used to. \n I realize that I now value meaning in life a lot more than I value \"happiness\". Seeking meaning may require sacrificing or not being \"happy\" in the short term to make a contribution or impact that is felt throughout the world. For me, an example of finding meaning in life would be working hard to create a solo musical project on the side. While I love making music, it's still a difficult undertaking, and requires dedication and sticking to it even when I'd rather be more momentarily \"happy\" by zoning out and watching more Scrubs on Netflix. I think in the end, meaning is what gives that deep seated happiness that stays with you permanently and shapes who you are. \n I'm sorry if this was blindingly obvious to all of you, but I thought it could be interesting to discuss.", "response": "It sounds like you're undergoing a significant shift in perspective, and I commend you for being so insightful about it. The pursuit of happiness and the search for meaning are indeed two different things, and sometimes they might even seem contradictory. It's quite normal that as we grow older, our priorities change and the things that used to bring us joy might no longer do so. \n\nYou mentioned that you've always strived to put yourself in positions that would make you happy, and you've achieved a lot. However, you're now finding that happiness alone isn't fulfilling enough. You're turning towards meaning, which you've beautifully described as something that might require short-term sacrifices but provides a deep-seated happiness that shapes who you are. \n\nIt seems like you're asking whether happiness or meaning is more important. There's no definitive answer to this as it largely depends on individual values and perspectives. Some people might find their happiness in the pursuit of meaning, while others might find meaning in their pursuit of happiness.\n\nThe key here is to reflect on what gives your life purpose, what makes it worthwhile. It's great that you've identified music as a source of meaning for you. Perhaps, you could explore this further. How does creating music make you feel? What about it gives your life meaning?\n\nRemember, it's a personal journey and it's entirely okay to be unsure. There's beauty in exploration and self-discovery. It's okay to question and rethink your priorities. What matters most is that you're true to yourself."}
{"input": "Too bad we can't just dig up all of Richmond Hill, melt all the gunk under the topsoil for low-grade fuel, sell it by the barrel to Americans, and dump the leftover sludge into Lake Simcoe. That would pay for lots of stuff!!", "response": "It sounds like you're thinking creatively about alternative ways to generate income. However, it also seems like you may be aware of potential negative environmental implications associated with these actions. Can you tell me more about this idea? Are there any similar, perhaps more sustainable, ideas that you have in mind?"}
{"input": "Yeah, and they've previously stated that day tripper was an attack on \"weekend hippies\". One of the original lines in it was \"she's a prick (later changed to big) teaser\". I don't have any links on the internet but I recall it being in the biography \"The Beatles\" written by Bob Spitz. I believe Norwegian Wood was based on an affair of John's with a reporter but I don't think she was a lesbian.", "response": "It sounds like you have a deep interest in and knowledge of The Beatles and their music. How do you feel about the meanings behind their songs, such as \"Day Tripper\" or \"Norwegian Wood\"? Do you think the personal experiences and views of the band members significantly influenced their music?"}
{"input": "Nope. I played WoW long enough, made the mistake of coming back to MMO's for TOR. Sick of chasing that f***ing carrot these companies throw out for the player. \n I would predict this will be a slightly less successful version of TOR. Another theme park MMO, people cream themselves because they can go back to Morrowind and Cyrodiil. TES fans will be happy because there will be a Daedric Realm expansion, a Sheogorath expansion and it will all come down to redressed mechanics, recycled locations and tired graphics - so tired that by the time this game will be released they will be outdated by a year and a half. They will make their money back on development, probably turn a profit and eventually go the way of LOTRO and TOR becoming free to play in less than a year. \n Why do MMO's fail? Blizzard was successful and have done a good job of at least maintaining a decent playerbase. But they are like the grand mother to AAA MMO games. They set the pace and all the others follow. They fail because of oversaturation. Ever been good at an MMO? Which at the end of the day = playing a ridiculous amount and participating in scheduled raids/flashpoints/whateverdafuqyouwannacallit. It gets old and it doesn't feel unique because once you reach the end... that's the end. The MMO design (currently anyway) is weak as it stands and can't sustain unless they find a way to beat the cyclical, rat-race syle game.", "response": "It sounds like you're feeling quite frustrated and disillusioned with the current state of MMO games. You've identified some key issues, such as a lack of uniqueness, recycled content, and the cyclical, rat-race nature of gameplay. I hear your longing for something different, something that breaks away from the current model and offers a fresh, engaging experience. Can you tell me more about what you would ideally like to see in an MMO game?"}
{"input": "A brick is a physical object made of physical compounds for a physical purpose. If a material scientist puts the brick through a series of chemical and structural experiments what the scientist will glean from the brick is assuredly beyond what the brickmaker \"intended.\" (Not to mention that the scientific data will have little to no importance to the third little piggy safe and snug in his townhouse.) \n A text is a cultural object, beholden to a historical moment, to psychological influences both conscious and unconscious of the writer and his audience. Also, a text comes out of a literary tradition that is not necessarily known by the average reader. This is especially true of Tolkien's work, and an examination of these factors will lead to many insights not apparent to someone who has seen the movies and made an attempt at reading the Silmarillion. \n To reduce the activity and applicability of literary criticism to a matter of intentions overlooks etymologies, cultural forces, the literary discourse, matters of politics, psychology, and tons of rich material that helps us to understand the impact and the meaning in a text.", "response": "I understand your thoughts on the depth and complexity inherent in a text. It's true, a text isn't merely a construction of words but a reflection of its creator's experiences, cultural background, and the historical time it was written in. The viewer's interpretation can also vary based on their individual experiences and understanding. \n\nIt seems that you believe that focusing solely on the author's intent might limit our understanding of the text. In your perspective, a deeper and more meaningful understanding can be gained by considering all the different factors that contribute to the creation and interpretation of the text. \n\nDo you think this approach should be applied to all forms of literature or are there specific works or genres that you believe would particularly benefit from this kind of analysis?"}
{"input": "Sorry to hear about your club. \n One piece of advice on this front: make it as easy as possible for people to get your clubs/gear back to you by having your info (name/email/phone) on every club using  or one of the many golf label services. \n We invest a lot of time and money in our golf gear and imo, this is $10 well spent.  I've been using these for the last 15+ years and since they come in sheets of 20, you always have a few left over to put on related gear like your range finder, golf gps, etc. \n Twice last season I left something on the green and both times received a call while still on the course from the person who found it thanks to the info on the label.", "response": "It sounds like you've found a really effective strategy for keeping your golf gear safe and accounted for. It must be a relief to know that if you misplace something, there's a good chance it'll find its way back to you due to the labels. If you don't mind me asking, what led you to start using this method?"}
{"input": "First off, you're level 9 and no offense but your build reflects that. You probably shouldn't be partied with your level 27 friend. There are better options for Tyr than Rage, Deathbringer, Frostbound, and especially Fatalis. I understand what you were doing, building him for auto attacks and all, but it's far from the best way to play Tyr. He uses abilities for most of his damage. You need to be building things like Void Blade, Shield, and Jotunn's. Tyr and the other bruisers are the most cookie cutter gods in the game. \n Also, a close 51 minute loss with a difference of 1 kill is certainly not the best scenario to cry \"OP.\" I'd like to also point out the fact that Poseidon had 15 deaths to go with his 20 kills, so he wasn't exactly mopping the place up.", "response": "It sounds like you're expressing some frustration with a gaming experience you've had recently. Perhaps you're feeling that some of your teammates weren't playing as effectively as they could have. It's completely normal to feel this way, especially when you invest time and effort into a game and the results don't meet your expectations. \n\nWould you like to discuss strategies for dealing with these feelings or perhaps some ways to communicate with your teammates more effectively?"}
{"input": "We have two dogs. One is seven, the other is one. Since the arrival of the younger pup, our older dog has decided he wants to mark his territory and has been peeing inside on all the furniture multiple times per day. We have never had this problem before... Training him as a puppy was effortless. \n Now none of our methods are effective. No matter what we do, he finds a way to pee inside. Even if we watch him like a hawk in the room, he'll straight up pee in front of us. \n He is not neutered, and the vet has told us this is our only hope in terms of making the accidents go away. We aren't really comfortable with doing this to him now that he's older, so as it stands, it's our last resort. \n Suggestions would be amazing! Anybody experience the same problem? Thanks!", "response": "I can understand your frustration and concern about your older dog's behavior changes since the arrival of the new puppy. It seems like you've tried a lot of things to address this issue, and it's not easy to see your pet struggling to adjust.\n\nCan I ask if there have been any other changes in the household or to the older dog's routine since the puppy arrived? Sometimes, dogs may respond to changes in their environment in unexpected ways. \n\nAdditionally, have you sought any professional advice from a dog trainer or animal behaviorist? They might be able to provide insights into your older dog's behavior and suggest approaches you haven't tried yet.\n\nLastly, maintaining a regular schedule for walks and playtime can help. Dogs are creatures of habit and having a routine can provide a sense of security. \n\nRemember, it's important to be patient and consistent. This is a big change for your older dog, and it might take some time for him to adjust."}

{"input": "I hate invincibility in video games. \n it seems more games add this mechanic to games especially in multiplayer and to me it always feels like a cop out. a couple examples are joanna from heroes of the storm and lissandra from league of legends. \n i feel there is no real interaction between players when invincibility is involved. if your opponent is invincible you just stand around and wait. if you are invincible there is nothing for you to think about. there is no meaningful decisions to be made. there is no counterplay. the worst example i can think of is WoW. i last played in ~2007 or 8 pre-burninng crusade so if it changed i apologize. anyway, whenever i would fight a paladin we both knew at some point in the fight he was going to go invincible and full heal and there was nothing i could do about it. i could outplay him through the whole fight but as soon as he was low bam invincibility and full heal. i would of course also heal up and the entire fight up to this point would have been mostly moot. \n if there was an ability or item that could be used to cancel out ones invincibility then there is some decision to be made and i am fine with this. \n i realize this problem is a little different in a team setting rather than a 1v1 setting as you have the decision to switch targets or force your opponent to switch targets, however even when doing so there is still nothing that can be done to that opponent. \n when you take away options and decisions the player becomes frustrated and the game no longer becomes fun. \n anyway i thought id start a discussion as i havent seen anybody talking about and would like to know others thoughts.", "response": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with the mechanic of invincibility in certain video games.

{"input": "I was there in person and here's what bothered me about the play... I have no problem with a ref making a bad call (I mean, i'll bitch about a bad call, but who doesn't). If it's a split-second decision and the ref thinks he sees something, so be it, sometimes they make mistakes. \n But on this hit, there was no split-second flag. Green went down, mccourty caught the loose ball and took off the other way. The linesman stood looking at green on the ground and it wasn't until he failed to get up that the flag came out. Mccourty was already down around the 30 yard line before the flag came out (about a 5-6 second delay from the hit). Now maybe he was having trouble pulling out the flag, but it sure seemed like the flag was thrown because the player was injured, not because the hit instantly warranted a penalty. \n I don't know what the guy was thinking during that 5-6 seconds, and I'm not sure what process the league uses to assess officials, but is it possible that the late flag was due to stricter penalties to officials for not calling an illegal hit that causes injury than mistakenly flagging a legal hit? \n The NHL has recently fallen victim to this, where calls are made based on the result of the play rather than the play itself. It's unfortunate because it penalizes circumstances as much as it does the actual play. For example in this play, green wasn't prepared for the hit because he was bobbling the ball. Had he made a clean catch maybe he could have had his body in a better position to take the hit and hopefully not have the same whiplash effect. \n Do you guys think the NFL is starting to react to the results of plays more than the plays themselves? I feel like I've seen more than a few pass interference flags not come out until the receiver complains this year (more so than in previous years).", "response": "It sounds like you are feeling frustrated and confused about some of the calls made during the game, particularly the one involving Green and McCourty. It's understandable that you would question the timing of the flag and the potential implications it may have on the game. \n\nYou're also raising some interesting questions about whether the focus has shifted from the action during the play to the outcome of the play. This could certainly change the dynamics of the game and potentially create an environment where players and teams feel they're being unjustly penalized or not properly protected.\n\nIt seems like you're noticing a pattern, particularly with pass interference flags and are wondering if the NFL is becoming more reactive than proactive. How does this perceived shift affect your experience as a viewer? Do you think these changes are necessary for the safety of the players or do they detract from the spirit of the game?"}

{"input": "Once, I carried a Christmas tree to my house from a local grocery store.\nTo illustrate the situation, it was me (5'9, 135 lb female) vs 7'5 foot tree. \nunfortunately, I do not drive and must rely on my friends at times to help me transport heavy things. But that year, Christmas was just around the corner and, as my patience was growing thin, I decided to bring the tree home myself. When I got to the store, they had two trees left - my tree and another small tree that has surely seen better days. My tree was a little taller than I was expecting to get, but, hey, I get more tree for the same price, so I was happy with that. \nYou see those Christmas posters with men effortlessly carrying Christmas trees on their shoulders and that how I was planning on carrying my tree. Guess what, trees are heavier than they look. At least heavier than I was expecting them to be. I was not able to place it on my shoulder, instead, I had to grab it somewhere below the waist, cling to it for dear life and run with it for a few meters before I would run out of breath. By the time I got to the nearest subway station I was sweating. The lady who sells subway tickets opened the stroller gate for me and, smiling broadly, said something about the true Christmas spirit. \nFour stops later I had to get off and transfer to a bus to take me home. By the time I got out of the subway station and took stairs to the nearest bus stop my face was red and I was sweating profusely. Several men have kindly offered me their assistance.

He's not a soccer fan and doesn't see a future in it, therefore doesn't want city funds allocated towards it.

It's one thing to say that citizens need to be careful of racial profiling, it's another altogether to exacerbate already-growing tensions with the NYPD like this. It's akin to Obama saying that the US Armed forces start illegal wars with impunity. NOT the best way to ease an already hostile situation, to put it lightly. He made it evident that he wanted to reform how NYPD goes about its work, but then places Bratton as police commissioner, aka the guy that championed the infamous practice of \"Stop and Frisk\". \n He promised tax hikes on the wealthy as part of his platform, but it's stalled and he hasn't done a thing to push it through.

{"input": "I know what you were really hoping for is a wall of text, so here it is! \n So the title pretty much sums it up.  I've posted here before but have recently come to the realization that I really have no idea what I'm looking for whether it's a friend, a girlfriend, a fwb situation, a online friend, a gaming buddy, a teammate or what have you.  But I am looking for something. \n Onto the about me section, well there's a lot to tell (as I'm sure could be said for most people).  I'm a guy, tall, dirty blonde, I enjoy intelligent conversation, art, photography, video games, movies, I wear my heart on my sleeve, I'm honest, I'm sincere, I'm happy, I'm sad, I like road trips, astronomy, camping, hiking, building things, going on adventures, I like going out, I like staying in, I don't smoke, I'm not much of a reader but am currently trying to broaden my literary horizons, I like the Simpsons, Futurama, Game of Thrones (just stared season 3, this is a spoiler free zone), Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Disneyland, and there's still probably 10,000,000 1/2 things that I could list here but that ought to be enough to get you started. If you send me a picture I shall of course reciprocate in kind :) \n So, reddit, I may not know what it is I'm looking for in a person, but hopefully you can surprise me!", "response": "It sounds like you're at a point in your life where you're open to different types of relationships and experiences, which is quite a fascinating and adventurous space to be in. It's okay not to have everything figured out, and it's quite normal to feel uncertain about what exactly you're looking for. \n\nExploring your interests, like you've mentioned - art, photography, video games, movies, astronomy, camping, hiking, and so on - can be a great way to meet new people who share the same passions. This can often lead to new and unexpected connections that might help you clarify what you're seeking. \n\nYou seem to have a broad range of interests and a curious mind. How are you currently pursuing these interests? Are you part of any clubs, online groups or communities where you can meet like-minded people? Also, you mentioned you're currently trying to broaden your literary horizons - what kind of books or genres are you exploring?"}
{"input": "Similar to ALL thee stories, and only occurred last year. This isn't a Christmas story, but my constantly spoiled cousin received and iPhone 3GS with a $60 a month plan when he was 17. He had never had a job, and didn't need to pay a cent for the contract. \nHe then got his first girlfriend, and was completely obsessed with the fact of actually having a girlfriend,  and would constantly force his mother to drive them everywhere. \nLiterally the first month after they started dating, his parents received a $2000+ phone bill. They were always under pressure from just the cost of living, but this?! \nI remember I was at their house staying over, and I was in bed listening to him scream and yell saying they weren't taking his phone or his \"right to be driven around, because that's what parents do\". I was so angry, I just wanted to get out of bed and hit him.", "response": "It sounds like you felt very frustrated and upset with your cousin's behavior. It seems like you saw him as being spoiled and entitled, which was difficult for you to watch, especially as it put pressure on his parents. How did you handle these feelings at that time?"}
